Purpose of SAP Activate and the Implementation Approach
Figure 1: SAP Activate - Driving Innovation
SAP Activate is an implementation methodology that is adaptable to a wide range of project 
sizes and complexities. It provides excellent guidance to all project streams like Architecture, 
Project Management, or Integration through its self-service capabilities, supporting 
customers, partners, and consultants to drive business initiatives in the digital age.

Figure 2: SAP Activate - Build on Proven Techniques
By leveraging the pre-delivered content, customers can jump-start the build using pre-built 
solutions as well as engineered services. With that, the SAP Activate framework provides a 
significant reduction in project time, reducing the Total Cost of Implementation (TCI) and 
Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).
Changed Business Expectations
Figure 3: Changed Business Expectations
In this lesson, we will discuss the origin of SAP Activate and the changes that it has brought 
about, in the way projects are delivered.

Video: Meeting the Changed Business Expectations
For more information on Meeting the Changed Business Expectations, please 
view the video in the lesson Describing SAP Activate in your online course.
The figure, Changed Business Expectations, shows the key shift that we are seeing in the 
delivery of projects. The left side of the figure represents the continuous push for lower costs 
of implementation and compressed time to value, which you can also approximate with the 
time it takes to deploy the solutions into production environment. The pace of change is 
increasing and there is more pressure to deliver projects faster.
Another change we have seen is the shift from the big-bang deployment projects to more 
focused projects that are implemented incrementally in multiple phases. In this new 
environment, customers are also looking to implement projects in a shorter time frame using 
accelerators and jump-start content.
Customers are also looking for a higher flexibility with options for solution deployment, 
ranging from deployment in the cloud, on-premise, hybrid, and access to information on 
mobile devices.
To meet this demand, SAP now offers the ability to deploy and manage solutions in the cloud, 
on-premise, and hybrid environments. SAP also offers mobile access to solution capabilities.
The various advantages that apply to cloud solutions will be highlighted in the following.
Figure 4: SAP Activate - Implementation Shift
SAP Activate is a transformative shift into a newer, more modern, and smarter 
implementation approach when compared to the traditional approach to software 
deployments. This book details all the capabilities and services through Best Practices, 
accelerators, and tools which support this model. The diagram above offers a high-level 
comparison between the old and the new.

Figure 5: What is the Purpose of SAP Activate?
The purpose of the SAP Activate framework is to expedite and/or fast track any and/or all 
deployment options for all SAP products. This is achieved using automated testing tools, 
ready-to-run systems, and ready-to use content (available in the SAP Activate Roadmap 
Viewer).
This ultimately leads to a lower Total Cost of Implementation:
1. As documentation effort is significantly reduced using accelerators.
2. As configuration time is significantly reduced using pre-build solutions.
In addition to the reduction to the cost of implementation, SAP provides Application Life-
Cycle management tools for the management of operations activities post go-live, effectively 
minimizing the costs of running your solution (that is, Reducing the Total Cost of Ownership – 
TCO).
SAP Activate Content
Figure 6: SAP Activate Content
Unit 1: Discovering SAP Activate

© Copyright. All rights reserved.
The SAP Activate Content includes accelerators in the form of documentation templates 
available to be used in each project phase, as well as pre-configured 'in-system' business 
processes, making the systems virtually ready-to-run after activation.
In addition to the accelerators, the SAP Activate framework provides system guidance in the 
form of configuration documents, data migration guidance, integration guidance, 
presentation materials, and video tutorials to support implementation teams with their 
project deployments.
All tools and content allow for an accelerated, guided, and expected outcome. This fosters 
customer, partner, and consultant enablement, while significantly lowering implementation 
risk.
●
SAP Best Practices provide projects with a baseline configuration.
●
Ready-to-run systems provide projects with a prototype.
●
Project accelerators which include project plans, document templates, and references to 
SAP information resources, provide project managers with the foundations for a project 
library.
●
For integration and migration areas, SAP provides system content and guidance.
Identify the SAP Activate Framework Variants
Figure 7: SAP Activate Framework Variant
SAP Activate is a product agnostic framework which caters for all SAP deployment options 
and products, whether cloud, on-premise, or private cloud. The framework is seamlessly 
adapted to suit any deployment model or product in SAP’s entire portfolio. In addition, SAP 
has provided several roadmaps for each deployment type.

The Three SAP Activate Pillars
Figure 9: SAP Activate Pillars
Animation: Reviewing the Key Pillars of the SAP Activate Framework
For more information on Reviewing the Key Pillars of the SAP Activate 
Framework, please view the animation in the lesson Describing the 3 Pillars of 
SAP Activate in your online course.
Let's review the key pillars of the SAP Activate framework, specifically the SAP Best 
Practices, Tools, and the SAP Activate Methodology.
We will start with the SAP Best Practices.
SAP delivers ready-to-run business processes that are optimized for SAP solutions.
We have Best Practices for integration, migration, and extensibility to expand the existing 
processes with the customer's own processes.
For customers or expert users who can command and configure a solution, there are tools for 
an assisted implementation that provide a self-service configuration user experience.
© Copyright. All rights reserved.
9
These tools empower business users to configure the environment much easier. The 
configuration transactions are accessible through the Implementation Guide (IMG).
The guided configuration also offers capabilities for what we call content lifecycle 
management. This involves looking at the configuration settings, and ensuring that the 
configuration settings set in that solution are not impacted by a new version of Best Practices, 
or a new version of processes being shipped in the next release of the SAP solution. This is 
extremely important in the cloud, where the release cycle is much more compressed.
SAP is constantly updating and rolling out new innovations. The pace of change increases 
with cloud solutions and customers are more frequently receiving innovations compared to 
on-premise solutions. Therefore, with cloud solutions, it is important to use the guided 
configuration tools.
The methodology is the third component or pillar of SAP Activate.
We are starting with a working system based on Best Practices, and one of the key pillars that 
we are using is an agile implementation methodology.
We offer different types of deployments into the cloud, on-premise, and the hybrid 
deployment.
The SAP Best Practices
Figure 10: Benefits of SAP Best Practices
SAP Best Practices helps project teams accelerate time to value. They provide content that 
helps jump start the implementation with ready-to-run processes and other assets.
The Best Practices contain rich business scenarios and business content. This helps 
customers get predictable and repeatable results from the Best Practices. The Best Practices 
and some prototyping, for example, personalization, additional configuration, or 
enhancements of the pre-delivered content, can be used as a baseline for an implementation 
project.
Best Practices can be deployed in the cloud, which further improves flexibility and time to 
value.

Figure 11: SAP Best Practices Formats
SAP Best Practices are available in two distinct formats:
1. Documentation:
The documented format of the SAP Best Practices can be found on the SAP Signavio 
Process Navigator, https://me.sap.com/processnavigator/HomePage. From this 
platform, best practices content is available for review, download, and use with your 
projects.
2. Configuration:
The configuration format of the best practices is found directly inside of the system. 
These best practices are preconfigured business processes which lay dormant inside of 
the system. Once activated these Best Practice processes are now 'ready to run'. 
Configuration best practices allow the user to execute the process inside the system.
The Deployment Tools and Structure
Figure 12: SAP Signavio Process Navigator

11
The SAP Signavio Process Navigator provides package content specific to the scope of your 
solution. It includes all business process scope in documentation format for all business 
processes inside the application.
The following information can be found in SAP Signavio Process Navigator:
●
Scope item fact sheets: A description of the business process including business benefits 
and key process steps covered.
●
Process flow: A representation of the standard business process to show how the software 
works by default.
●
Process flow (BPMN2): A downloadable version of the business process flow that can be 
edited in process modeling applications if the standard process flow is customized. It's 
important to document any process that no longer follows the standard process.
●
Test scripts: A procedure for testing the standard Best Practice processes in the system.
●
Set-up instructions: A guide with instructions to set up the prerequisite requirements 
(usually an integration) before the test script can be completed.
You can reduce the cost of operations by using the pre-delivered processes, and use the 
country-specific content to manage multiple geographies, divisions, subsidiaries, and ledgers. 
Best Practice content is updated on the Release to Customer (RTC) date for your selected 
solution with the latest enhancements and new features.
Figure 13: SAP Signavio Process Navigator - Information Structure
The following additional content can be found on the SAP Signavio Process Navigator.
●
SAP Signavio Process Navigator Solution Package: contains descriptions and 
corresponding content.
●
Guidance: helps select best approach, for example, in Analytics or Integration.
●
Solution Description: provides high-level structure and description, such as Partner 
Solutions.
For cloud solutions tool: SAP S/4HANA Cloud Release Assessment and Scope Dependency 
helps to find inter-dependencies between scope items for upgrade planning.

Figure 16: Activating Best Practices in System
SAP configuration Best Practices is an accelerator, as the standard processes are already 
configured, and once activated, make the system 'ready to run'. But Best Practices may not 
always provide coverage for every customer around the world. In any case, should the Best 
Practice provide good coverage for the business, then creating a Best Practice client and 
activating the Best Practice processes is the preferred approach. When the Best Practices do 
not provide coverage for the business, the traditional approach is applied, which entails 
configuring the system from the beginning without leveraging the Best Practices.
Figure 17: Overview: Guided Configuration Concept in SAP S/4HANA On-Premise
The configuration Best Practices can be found in the Solution Builder transaction using 
transaction code /n/SMB/BBI inside of the SAP S/4HANA system.

Figure 18: Solution Builder
From the Solution Builder, all available Solution Packages can be searched for by country, 
language, and version. Once found using the Implementation assistant all project / customer 
scope, Best Practice can be activated.
The task is performed by the SAP Basis consultant when doing an on-premise 
implementation, and is a service performed by SAP when doing a Cloud or Private Cloud 
deployment.

Figure 20: Guided Configuration
Configuration in the public cloud solution is performed via Self-Service Configuration UI 
(SSCUI) and the Configuration system.
SAP Central Business Configuration is a tool designed to configure business processes from 
one central place. It facilitates leveraging Solution Builder's Best Practice content. Leading to 
increased business process flexibility and reduced configuration efforts.
Configuration for on-premise solutions as well as private cloud is performed via the traditional 
Implementation Guide (IMG) in Transaction SPRO.
Figure 21: Central Business Configuration
SAP Central Business Configuration is designed to provide guidance for your implementation 
project by controlling the completed activities sequence. In the Project Experience, you can 
manage your team members, complete activities to set up and configure your systems, and 
view the project status. Activities are grouped into phases, and each phase ends with a 
milestone.
Unit 1: Discovering SAP Activate

Figure 22: Central Business Configuration
The configuration activities in SAP Central Business Configuration are designed to support 
customers in adapting the preconfigured SAP Best Practices content to their requirements. 
The available configuration activities are based on the active scope and country selections. 
Configuration activities may vary by country because not all business scenarios (scope items) 
are available in all countries. Configuration activities can be mandatory, recommended, or 
optional.
The Project Management tasks from SAP Central Business Configuration can also be 
transferred to SAP Cloud ALM for Implementation. Then the status can be tracked centrally in 
SAP Cloud ALM for Implementation together with all project tasks, requirements, user 
stories, testing activities and defects.
Figure 23: PCE and OP Delta Configuration
All configuration for on-premise and private cloud is performed via the IMG in transaction 
SPRO. By starting your build with the activated Best Practices, consultants only need to 
perform delta configuration to configure the additional functions or features requested by the 
business during the Explore phase workshops.

The SAP Activate Methodology and Benefits
Figure 24: Methodology
The third component/pillar of the SAP Activate framework is the SAP Activate Methodology.
The SAP Activate Methodology provides one simple, modular, and agile methodology, and is 
the successor of ASAP and SAP Launch methodologies.
SAP Activate Methodology provides full support for initial deployment and continuous 
business innovation with a harmonized implementation approach for cloud, on-premise, and 
hybrid deployments.
SAP Activate Methodology is designed to support all SAP solutions.
The methodology also enables co-innovation with customers, and is accessible for partners.
The methodology uses, as default, agile project delivery principles. It builds on the ready-to-
run business processes and the SAP Best Practices documentation. It uses the configuration 
tools to adjust the baseline solution to customer needs based on the results of the fit-
standard workshops, which is conducted in the Explore phase.
The SAP Activate Methodology provides project teams with structured approaches to 
implement the solution and the solution and product specific content for implementation or 
transition to SAP S/4HANA and other SAP products.
The SAP ecosystem is familiar with the ASAP methodology. there are some differences 
between SAP Activate and ASAP that you should be aware of for an on-premise 
implementation:
In SAP Activate Methodology, we are leveraging the SAP Best Practices as a default way to 
build the baseline system for fit-to-standard.
There are four core project phases in SAP Activate that we do not have separate phases for 
the final preparation and go-live support, but instead execute them in one phase called 
'DEPLOY'.
In the SAP community page, you can learn about SAP Activate, which describes the 
deliverables per phase. This helps those accessing the SAP Activate materials to review 
content and to understand the key goals of a phase.
The blueprint activities that were represented in ASAP, have been replaced with fit-to-
standard analysis workshops. The project team uses the SAP Best Practices based system to 
validate the customer's requirement against a working baseline solution. Then, the team 
captures the delta requirements and/or user stories in the backlog. This information is then 
used for implementation of requirements during the Realize phase.
SAP Activate Methodology supports not only the on-premise deployment, but also cloud 
deployment, with one consistent approach. SAP Activate brings together the approach for on-
Unit 1: Discovering SAP Activate

premise and cloud. It harmonizes the approach across these different deployment models 
which also helps to support hybrid deployment projects.
SAP Activate supports not only SAP S/4HANA, but also other solutions like SAP 
SuccessFactors, SAP Sales Cloud, SAP Service Cloud and SAP Ariba. SAP offers content for 
these solutions in the SAP Activate Methodology, which can be found in the SAP Activate 
Roadmap Viewer.
Figure 25: Phase Overview
The SAP Activate Methodology six phase descriptions will vary slightly for each 
implementation scenario (for example, SAP Activate Methodology for SAP Cloud for 
Sustainable Enterprises) but will have the same phase name. In the example in the figure SAP 
Activate Methodology for RISE with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition will have the 
following high-level phase descriptions:
Discover phase
In the Discover phase customer’s core team is enabled to understand breadth, depth, and 
functionality of RISE with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition. The team would learn the 
benefits and value the solution can bring to customers’ business.
Prepare phase
The Prepare phase is where the project is jump-started. The project environment gets set up, 
the project manager needs to set up the project governance, clarifying the project team roles 
and responsibilities, and provide the team with project standards. Project is kicked off and the 
team starts answering the Business-Driven Configuration questionnaire. Towards the end of 
this phase the team will be setting up the initial system for fit-to-standard workshops.
Explore phase
In this Explore phase the project team will conduct fit-to-standard workshops, verify, and 
confirm the to-be business processes with process models. Meanwhile master data and 
organizational requirements get identified. Organizational learning needs are identified and 
documented. After sign-off on delta requirements, design documents, and implementation 
plan the Q-gate from Explore to realize gets closed.
Realize phase
Project management joint with workstreams will plan sprints. Project team focuses on 
implementing defined solution using incremental build iterations. It will configure, extend, 
integrate, test, confirm, and document the entire end-to-end solution and prepare for legacy 
data conversion. The project team actively works with business representatives to ensure a 
good fit of the built solution to the requirements from the backlog.
The team executes build cycles called ‘Sprints’ to build and test the functionality. The team 
will conduct walkthroughs with the business users within each sprint to provide frequent 
Lesson: Describing the 3 Pillars of SAP Activate

19
checkpoints that the build is meeting the requirements. And will go through multiple iterations 
to develop functionality that is then ready to be released to production. For each release, the 
team conducts full end-to-end testing. The project team releases results of multiple iterations 
to the business users to accelerate time to value and provide early access to finalized 
functionality. Each sprint release is thoroughly tested in the end-to-end integration test and 
the user acceptance test.
The Realize phase is completed with the Realize-to-Deploy Q-Gate
Deploy phase
In the Deploy phase, the team makes sure that the business is ready to perform the cutover 
activities. The complexity of these activities will depend on various factors including the 
number of users that are impacted by the solution and the business scope of the deployment. 
Teams may need to conduct multiple cutover simulations as part of the preparation for go-
live. Once the solution is live, the project team provides a defined period of post go-live 
support (sometimes called the hyper-care period). The project is then formally closed, and 
the solution is now in a separate PRODUCTIVE OPERATIONS or RUN phase
Run phase
Customer is live, with this begins the continuous learning process, that includes validation of 
newly released features and value assessment of business relevant innovations against 
current solution.
Behind this high-level phase descriptions, SAP Activate Methodology provides helpful details 
for deliverables and tasks as well as more sources to relevant information.

Animation: Breaking Down the Methodology Structure
For more information on Breaking Down the Methodology Structure, please view 
the animation in the lesson Describing the Methodology Structure in your online 
course.
The figure, Methodology Breakdown, shows the taxonomy of the SAP Activate Methodology 
which consists of the following structure:
●
Phases are stages of the project. At the end of each phase, a quality gate exists to verify 
the completion of the deliverables. SAP Activate consists of four core phases.
●
Workstream is a collection of deliverables performed by a team and delivered across 
phases. A workstream shows time relationships within a project and other streams. 
Workstreams span across phases and are not necessarily dependent on phase start and 
end.
© Copyright. All rights reserved.
25
●
Deliverable is a key outcome that is delivered over the course of the project. Several 
deliverables are included within a workstream. Multiple deliverables are assigned to the 
workstream and each deliverable is then broken down into individual tasks.
●
Tasks represent the work or the activities that the project team performs. A group of tasks 
leads to the creation of the deliverable, which represents a tangible outcome that is 
handed over to the customer, or may be an interim outcome in the context of the project.
Figure 27: SAP Activate Phases
The figure, SAP Activate Phases, outlines the phases of SAP Activate Methodology.
The core of the project delivery happens between the Prepare and the Deploy phases. These 
are referred to as the four core phases.
Discover and Run are additional phases that are described in more detail later.
In the Prepare phase, we define the scope of work, project governance, prepare the sandbox / 
starters systems, start the project, identify and define the resources, define the roles and 
responsibilities for the project team, and detail the management plans for running the project 
among other activities.
In the Explore phase, we run the fit-to-standard workshops using the SAP Best Practice 
content and demonstrate standard processes using the sandbox or starter systems. The 
objective of the Explore phase is to identify the fit of the Best Practices-based solution to the 
business, capture delta configuration requirements, and identify gaps and configuration 
values. All these are captured by the project team in the product backlog.
During the Realize phase, the project team adopts an agile approach to iteratively and 
incrementally build the functionality from the backlog. This build follows the prioritization 
given by the product owner (for example, the business users) that continue to be involved 
with the project team during the sprints. During the build, the team adds the configuration 
and development on top of the Best Practices content (Deltas). Additionally, the team 
performs unit and (at times) string testing during the sprints. In the Realize phase, the team 
also works on the integration of the overall solution to meet customer needs.
The Realize phase covers all the build and test activities required to prepare a release of 
functionality into production. This includes a full integration test and user acceptance test 
before the team can continue into the Deploy phase.

The objective of the Deploy phase is to set up the production environment and confirm 
readiness to switch into business operations with the new solution. The team also performs 
sustainment and hypercare activities in the Deploy phase once the system goes live.
Once the customer has switched over into the new environment, the project team helps the 
customer's IT and Business departments to adopt and use the functionality. The team stays 
on-site for a predetermined period of time, which is usually defined in the contract or agreed 
as part of the plan to transition to operations.
Figure 28: Additional Phases
The figure, Additional Phases, shows two additional phases of SAP Activate.
The Discover phase is a non-committal phase where customers can discover and research all 
offerings available within the SAP portfolio, and determine which innovations are most 
applicable and suitable for their organization. SAP provides several discovery resources to 
existing and prospective customers, ranging from white papers and presentations, to trial 
systems and games.
Discover phase deliverables include:
Overall Innovation Strategy and Roadmap Creation:
In the first deliverable, customers create an overall company strategy for their digital 
transformation. This may include SAP S/4HANA as the digital core, but contains a broader 
perspective. Key topics like Internet of things, Big Data, Smart Data, Omni-channel, or 
Business Networks can also be captured in the strategy.
Value and Impact Analysis:
Customers should become more familiar with the value of other SAP products in general (that 
is, the new and simplified functionality in e.g. SAP S/4HANA, the new User Interface based on 
SAP FIORI, agile customer innovations using SAP BTP, and so on). A trial system in the Cloud 
can further support this.
Implementation Strategy:
A decision on the implementation scenario and comprehensive implementation strategy for 
any SAP Product implementation will be created.
In case of system conversion, the conversion readiness of the existing SAP ERP system will 
also be checked.
A learning needs analysis for the project team is important as this can impact other activities 
in the program. E.g. the completion of learning should be finalized prior to participating in 
project workshops.

27
Technical Architecture and Infrastructure:
The Technical Architecture and Infrastructure requirements should be clarified to support the 
innovation strategy and the proposed implementation.
The Run phase
Run is referred to as a phase in Activate but has a methodology of its own. Run is effectively 
the support or management of the productive solution post go-live.
SAP has several standards for running a solution optimally, which range from incident and 
change management, system and application monitoring, to upgrade management. There are 
16 standards in total.
There are also different models that can be applied when running or supporting SAP 
solutions, some which are the setting up a Customer Center of Expertise (CCoE) or run SAP 
like a factory or premium engagement. Each of these are models and approaches related to 
the maintaining and supporting of the SAP solution once live, and tailored to customer size 
and needs. Additional information can be found on the SAP support portal.

Workstream Description
Figure 29: Workstream Description (1 of 3)
Across the following three diagrams, we detail the SAP Activate Methodology workstreams 
and their related descriptions. Those familiar with ASAP and SAP Launch should review the 
workstream descriptions as they have changed significantly from the previous roadmaps.
The workstreams are optimized and aligned with various implementation scenarios. They are 
also adjusted based on feedback from initial projects that used SAP Activate Methodology 
content.
The first workstream is Project Management, which covers all the aspects of setting up the 
project, running it, and delivering on the project objectives. The Project Management 
workstream is structured around the fundamentals of agile project delivery, and is aligned 
with Project Management Institute standard, the PM Body of Knowledge (PMBOK).
There are a set of Application workstreams that deal with different aspects of the application 
itself. These include design, configuration, testing, and integration. These workstreams cover 
Unit 2: Outlining SAP Activate Methodology Foundation

the core of the work done on the solution to adjust it to fit customer needs. This includes the 
design and configuration activities, such as running the fit-to-standard workshops or 
configuring the system. It also covers the development of extensions, testing including 
integration, performance, system tests, regression testing, as well as User Acceptance 
Testing (UAT).
Figure 30: Workstream Description (2 of 3)
The Solution Adoption workstream deals with what was previously covered in the 
Organizational Change Management (OCM) stream and training stream in ASAP. The 
adoption activities enable the organization and end users to use the solution in their daily 
work. The deliverables and tasks guide the project team in ensuring a smooth transition to 
operations, post go-live support, and change management.
The Analytics workstream covers the analytics aspects of an SAP implementation project.

Figure 39: Fit-to-Standard Design Principles
Following are the principles to be applied in the fit-to-standard workshops:
●
Fit-to-standard: Adopting a Fit-to-standard approach and SAP standard functionality, will 
minimize delivery risk and ultimately lower the total cost of the implementation and 
operation.
●
Value Justification: SAP applications are built on industry best practices and any proposed 
customizations should be motivated against business value.
●
Show and Tell: Leading design activities through showing rather than telling, contributes 
significantly to business adoption, enablement and acceptance
●
Active Participation: Active participation by the business users in the design and 
acceptance activities fosters collaboration and is key to delivering a successful solution.
●
Focus on simplicity: When designing the solution, focus on simplicity and ease of use while 
minimizing unnecessary complex functionality as far as possible.
●
Design Acceptance: Applying these principles in Fit-to-Standard workshops facilitates 
adoption and leads to design acceptance by the business.

Figure 42: Enabling Business Users Before Workshops
A major consideration before executing the fit-to-standard workshops is to enable business 
users on key topics that will be covered in the workshops. These include enablement on 
master data concepts, SAP terminology, workshops' approach, and the SAP Activate 
Methodology, among other activities.
Enablement sessions should be aligned to project scope to better prepare the business 
audience for active participation in the workshops.
Figure 43: How to Run Workshops - Accelerator
Here is an example of an accelerator on how to run your fit-to-standard workshops, which is 
available for download from the SAP Activate Roadmap Viewer and for use in your projects.

Sprints
Sprints are a unit of measure or a period or time between two to four weeks long, where 
incremental building of the solution takes place. Generally ending with a show and tell session 
back to the business audience that raised the requirement in the workshop.
Waves
Waves are a unit of measure, and larger period with many sprints assigned to a one Wave. 
Waves are generally one to three months in duration.
Phases
The Realize phase is the build phase and consists of one or more waves depending on the size 
of the project.
Release
A release is all functionalities built ending with a go-live. Projects can have one or several 
releases, depending on project scope and time.
Figure 50: Realize Phase in Sprints
This diagram provides a good illustration of what a typical Realize phase looks like in an agile 
context. In the example, there are several sprints from the start of the phase, ending with a 
user acceptance testing. Included in this example is i firm-up sprint where string testing is 
performed. Sting testing tests the integration or overlap aspects of the functionality built in 
the prior sprints.
Integration testing can also be delivered via sprints. Integration testing covers the testing of 
all functionalities built. This is the final testing performed by the consulting team before the 
business team tests the system in User Acceptance Testing.

Agile: Use of Scrum-Based Approach to Build Solutions
Figure 51: Agile: Use of Scrum-Based Approach to Build Solutions
Video: Illustrating a Sprint Cycle
For more information on Illustrating a Sprint Cycle, please view the video in the 
lesson Analyzing each phase of SAP Activate in your online course.
This is an example of a sprint cycle. The scope of work is contained on the product backlog 
from where Sprint Planning activities take place. All activities planned for inclusion in the 
sprint are transferred to the Sprint Backlog / Scrum Board. The team performs tasks during 
the sprint, and a daily scrum meeting is conducted to determine the status of tasks 
completed and what activities are planned for the day.
The last day of the sprint ends with the Sprint Review. This task is a 'show and tell' to the 
business of the requirements that were built during this Sprint. The final ceremony on the last 
day in the sprint cycle is the Sprint Retrospective, where the team reviews how well they 
managed the sprint, and agrees on suggestions and recommendations for improving the 
sprint process for the next sprint.

Figure 52: Agile: Scrum Board View
The Sprint Backlog is a list of tasks identified by the Scrum team to be completed during the 
Sprint. During Sprint planning, the team plans and selects several Product Backlog items, and 
identifies the tasks necessary to complete each User Story.
A Scrum Board is a tool that helps teams make Sprint Backlog items visible. The board can be 
physical or digital but serves the same purpose of tracking sprint tasks. The board is updated 
by the team during daily stand-up session and displays all items that need to be completed for 
the current Sprint.
Figure 53: Sprint Ceremonies in Large Projects
The diagram above illustrates the scrum ceremonies performed in a large project. Emphasis 
behind this slide is, that within a large project, many resources are part of the project team. 
Essentially, each resource wears 'one cap' and/or a segregation of duties is enforced.
An example of this could be that in a large project, a project manager will only perform project 
management activities, as the project may have a dedicated release manager and quality

manager. Similarly in a large project, there may be a testing team. In this case, the functional 
consultants will not be responsible for any testing, as the testing team will assume that 
function.
Figure 54: Sprint Ceremonies in Small Projects
The above diagram illustrates the scrum ceremonies performed in a small project. Emphasis 
behind this slide is, that smaller projects have less resources, in their project team, and each 
resource may need to perform more than one function on the project, essentially wearing 
'more caps'.
An example of this could be that in a small project, a project manager will not only perform 
project management activities but may also need to perform release management or quality 
management tasks. Similarly in a small project, there may not be a dedicated testing team. In 
this case, the functional consultants will also be responsible for testing related tasks.

This diagram displays an example of a solution with two releases. In the example displayed 
above, the first part of the solution is built using sprints in the Realize phase, and subsequent 
deploy activities performed in the Deploy phase. The first release then goes live and the 
solution is now productive. After go-live, the project immediately enters the hypercare period, 
where all project consultants perform support related tasks and activities to support the 
business with the adoption of the new solution. Once the hypercare period has ended, the 
second release activities are started, and performed through the different phases until the 
second go-live, where the entire solution becomes productive.

Figure 60: SAP ALM Standards for Operation
SAP has a total of sixteen standards for key operations processes within a company's 
business and IT units.
Each standard contains best-practice procedures on how to run the individual tasks, 
explanations on which tools inside SAP Solution Manager should be used, and available 
training and services that support the adoption of the standard. The implementation and 
optimization of these SAP Standards for solution operations are the key deliverables of the 
Run phase work packages.
These key standards and practices address the needs of business process experts who are 
responsible for the design and execution of business processes, and of IT departments who 
ensure that the services provided by the SAP solutions are available for business users post 
go-live.
The SAP standards for operation are available for download at:

Challenges and Opportunities Transforming to SAP S/4HANA
Figure 78: Challenges and Opportunities Transforming to SAP S/4HANA
Before we talk about the challenges and opportunities that customers face when they 
transform to SAP S/4HANA, let us take a moment to reflect why change far beyond what is 
required from a technical point of view is inevitable.
In the 1990s SAP was heavily developing SAP ERP. Also during this decade, cell telephones 
became increasingly popular.
You (more or less) could be reached by anybody, anytime, anywhere – by voice or by text. 
This had a huge impact not only on communication but also on everyone’s behavior. If you 
could not reach someone you could leave a voicemail or send a text message. If you wanted to 
meet a friend you no longer needed to tell him exactly when and where to meet, but simply 
say: give me a call when you are ready.
Fast forward to today – we still use cell phones but the way we use them has changed entirely 
as technology dramatically advanced:
●
Some of you still do calls or send short message, but most likely you have a favorite app, 
sending voice messages or pictures
●
Your cell phone became your camera
●
If you travel, you will for sure have an app will give you a predication when you should start 
or when you will arrive

67
These are just a few examples. Our experiences in our private life determines nowadays also 
our requirements for business applications – and the expectations of customer to 
organizations and their processes. Processes and applications need to be:
●
Simple
●
Fast
●
Flexible
●
Supporting instant communications
●
Being accessible from anywhere, anytime
SAP ERP was built in the 90s. Like the cell phone, even though they will still run, they do not 
meet the requirements of today's world. Therefore, change is inevitable.
Figure 79: Challenges and Opportunities Transforming to SAP S/4HANA
To meet these requirements we built SAP S/4HANA with key design principles such as the 
following:
●
Usage of our In-Memory database HANA
●
Choice of deployment between a public and private cloud
●
Goal to simplify processes and provide a new user interface that can be accessed also via 
mobile devices
Existing SAP customers who have been running one or multiple SAP ERP systems for many 
years find themselves faced with not only the move to SAP S/4HANA and process changes, 
but very often even with a bigger cloud transformation project requiring even more processes 
to be-redesigned. But also new SAP customers who have taken the decision to implement 
SAP S/4HANA must transform their legacy processes while implementing SAP S/4HANA.
The transition to SAP S/4HANA, Grow with SAP or RISE with SAP, has the goal to move to the 
Public Cloud or the Private Cloud. It requires to consider what is the right amount of systems 
that suits an organization best.
Taking into account the current state and the desired future there are three potential 
transformation paths that are possible:
●
New Implementation
Unit 3: Using SAP Signavio to Support S/4HANA Transformations
68
© Copyright. All rights reserved.
●
System Conversion
●
Selective Data transition
Customers might have already made a decision which transformation path is the right one for 
their organization or they are still uncertain which path to choose, and they might not have 
defined when they will move to SAP S/4HANA as both value and costs are unclear.
Irrespectively of the current state, the future state and the transition path, business process 
will change when moving to S/4HANA initially but also continuously beyond, as an ERP 
system needs to evolve as any business keeps changing and an investment into an ERP must 
generate value.
In line with the initial business process change a new implementation is often referred to a 
greenfield (as a high number of processes will be impacted). A system conversion is called 
brownfield (as the number of process that you will keep is higher) or as blue field/goldfield or 
any other mixed color to indicate that it is a combination of both.
While the initial amount of process change might be different, over time you will touch 
gradually almost all your business processes. This (business process) change results in 
challenges but also opportunities for which you need to find answers which will drive your SAP 
S/4HANA transformations. So let us talk about what these challenges and opportunities are.
How Do You Ensure that Your Transformation Adds Value?
The transformation to SAP S/4HANA is for every organization a big project requiring a 
significant investment. Therefore, the first challenge that we discuss is: How does an 
organization ensure that the transformation adds value?
Figure 80: How Do You Ensure that Your Transformation Adds Value?
In order to ensure that the transition to SAP S/4HANA adds value to a business, an 
organization need to improve their business processes.
The starting point to any improvement is transparency on how processes are executed today. 
Most organizations that I have had the chance to work with had little or no transparency in 
their current process performance. Are there blockers that prevent the processes from 
running as efficiently as possible? Are there certain units of the organizations where 
processes are executed much better than in other units. The first step to achieve value is to 
gain process transparency.
Lesson: Describing challenges and opportunities transforming to SAP S/4HANA

69
In the next step, organizations need to validate the process improvement potential together 
with their business stakeholders and process experts, and make them quantifiable. By 
describing what value an organization can get from changing processes, it is possible to make 
an initial prioritization and focus where it matters most. Organizations also need to ensure 
that they overcome the resistance of any change by ensuring management buy-in. In 
summary, the next step that organizations must achieve is to make the value of change 
measurable.
If organizations have identified process improvement potential and qualified the value of the 
improvement, they then need to know how to realize the value. What are the new SAP S/
4HANA innovations that they should consider to improve processes? Are there any changes 
that organizations can do prior to the move to SAP S/4HANA? Organizations need to re-
design processes in order to realize the value.
During the transformation, organizations implement new SAP S/4HANA Innovations to 
realize the defined process improvements in close collaboration between business and IT, 
enabling their users on the new way of working. Once have gone live with SAP S/4HANA, 
organizations start to measure the value contribution of the process improvements gaining 
process transparency again.
Throughout each step organizations need to ensure alignment among all stakeholders and 
communicate actively to connect the dots from initial findings to process changes being 
implemented.
Providing process transparency, making the value of change measurable and identifying how 
to change processes also allows organizations to ensure that their SAP S/4HANA transition is 
not just an IT initiative, but a business initiative. By showing quantifiable business benefits, 
organizations obtain management buy in to provide critical business resources to the project 
required to make change happen.
How Does an Organization Make Their Transformation As Fast As Possible
ERP transformations in general are widely known as being over time and over budget – and 
are by no means fast. Therefore, the second challenge that organizations are facing is: How 
does an organization make the transformation as fast as possible?
Fast time to adapt means to:
●
Define target processes taking not only into account the already gained insights and 
recommendations but additional to leverage SAP Best Practice content, in other words 
don’t start from scratch but take SAP standard as the basis for future processes that are 
validated in Fit-to-Standard workshop
●
Be able to use the process design during the solution build, test and deploy which is 
supported by application lifecycle management with a tight integration avoiding data 
redundancy ('integrated toolchain')
●
To ensure collaboration among all stakeholders in Business and IT
Fast Time to Insights and Fast Time to Adapt get facilitated by our end-to-end business 
process transformation methodology that you will get to know in more detail later.
The key steps of this methodology are displayed as an infinity loop on the screen. Change 
does not stop with the move to SAP S/4HANA but continues infinitely afterwards.

Figure 81: How Does an Organization Make Their Transformation As Fast As Possible?
To accelerate the overall transformation project, organizations need to shift up gears and 
shorten the lead time of the transformation phases.
Let’s have a look at two key levers:
On the one hand, organizations should aim for Fast Time to Insights.
Fast time to insights means to:
●
Gain quick insights 'where to change' by understanding how process are running today
●
Getting recommendations 'how to change'
On the other hand organizations should aim for Fast Time to Adapt of process changes in IT 
systems they prioritized in the beginning.
How Does an Organization Ensure that Change Is Manageable?
You've probably heard the saying: “never change a running process or system - it works”. This 
is usually done to avoid any change, as change is always associated with risk. Transparency of 
process change, and collaboration can reduce risk drastically and thereby making change 
manageable, change which is inevitable to add value. Therefore, the third challenge is: How 
does an organization ensure that change is manageable?
Figure 82: How Does an Organization Ensure that Change Is Manageable?
Making the transformation manageable builds upon the answers of the two previous 
questions.
Manageable means that organizations:

1. Follow a clearly structured transformation approach with a set of defined steps/milestone 
and objectives.
2. Make the transformation targets as well as the necessary process changes not only 
transparent to everyone but ensure that everyone supports them.
3. Have management buy-in for the project as it is a business initiative and not an IT-
initiative.
4. Break down silos between all business and IT stakeholders – using processes as the 
vehicle.
5. Have sufficient human resources empowered to make decisions, in other words roles and 
responsibilities are clearly defined.
6. Embed change management and enablement into your transformation as a critical 
success factor.
SAP S/4HANA Transformations are Business Initiatives
If customers want to drive their SAP S/4HANA transformation they need to find answers to 
the three questions and associated challenges:
●
How does an organization ensure that the transformation adds value?
●
How does an organization make the transformation as fast as possible?
●
How does an organization ensure that change is manageable?
SAP Signavio solutions will help customers to find answers for these challenges. In the next 
chapter, you will get to know SAP Signavio solutions before you get an overview how you can 
leverage them during your transformation to drive your SAP S/4HANA transformation to 
success.
The most important point again: SAP S/4HANA transformation are business initiatives and 
not IT projects.
Customers reduce the value SAP S/4HANA can provide to an organization drastically, if they 
only focus on a technical implementation or if they only implement what has been built in the 
past.  It's important for a continuous value generation to set the foundation of a continuous 
improvement journey. The investment that customers make into Business Process 
Transformation Management will not only unlock the value that SAP S/4HANA brings to their 
organization by changing business processes, it will also be essential to reduce the debts of 
the past, such as no longer required modifications or process enhancements.

SAP Signavio Overview
Figure 83: Four Dimensions to Transform Successfully
A successful transformation does not have the goal of transitioning existing SAP ERP 
processes to SAP S/4HANA by changing one system (aka solution) with another. To 
transform successfully to SAP S/4HANA requires to take four dimensions into account:
●
Business Strategy: Take the business strategy as the key element of their transition 
executing on the company's business strategy to enable business outcomes such as 
agility, resilience, transparency, collaboration as well as governance.
●
Processes: Ensure customer value adding, efficient, reliable and scalable business 
operations based on the business strategy thereby driving optimization and harmonization 
in line also with compliance and regulatory requirements.
●
Systems: As part of the transition, they leverage technology innovations and automation 
capabilities across core applications and the extensibility platform.
●
People: Collaboration breaks down barriers and is the prerequisite for change.
Remark: These dimensions are relevant for a successful transformation and not only for the 
transition to SAP S/4HANA.

Figure 84: From Strategy to Execution: Approach
Transforming successfully means that you connect all four dimensions:
●
Translating your business strategy into a set of well-defined processes that need to be 
analyzed and redesigned
●
Leveraging Technology and Automation capabilities during the implementation
●
Ensuring process success by putting people at the center of the transformation
Once the new processes are live, and your business users are enabled, and the processes are 
executed, the next step is to start to analyzing process performance. This is done to 
determine whether processes can be enhanced, in which case an incremental (re-) design is 
required. As your business strategy evolves to meet your customer, supplier, employees and 
other demands, processes need to be adapted.
Process Analysis and Process Design, as shown on the slide, are supported by SAP Signavio. 
Solution Design including the Design, Build, Test and Deploy of the Process Design is 
supported by our Application Lifecycle Management Solution (SAP Solution Manager and 
SAP Cloud ALM). SAP S/4HANA transformation is often part of a bigger transformation, 
sometimes labeled as Cloud Transformation. This is also the case as processes are not just 
executed in an ERP solution but are realized based on multiple solutions. To translate the 
business strategy into a holistic enterprise architecture, developing transition roadmaps is an 
essential prerequisite which is executed as a capability planning. The end-to-end toolchain 
starts therefore with the discipline of Enterprise Architecture Management (supported by 
LeanIX), SAP Signavio for Process Analysis and Process Design related tasks, and SAP 
Application Lifecycle Management Solution (SAP Solution Manager and SAP Cloud ALM) for 
the Solution Design. To have this end-to-end toolchain in place prior to the start of the 
transformation supporting, accelerating and digitalizing the various artifacts that are created 
is a MUST.

Figure 85: Enabling Full Business Process Transformation
The above figure shows the two key outcomes:
●
Fast-time-to-action (not only actually to insights, but action to be taken, e.g. a process-
redesign during the SAP S/4HANA transformation)
●
Fast-time-to-adapt
Business Process Transformation as highlighted on the previous slides requires the interlock 
of various dimensions: Seamless integration with Enterprise Applications (EAM/ALM), the 
design not only of processes (supported by Design Accelerators such as standard process 
content) but also entire journeys, as well as the understanding of current processes with 
predefined out-of-the-box analytics, as well as process mining capabilities and the integration 
with our automation platform.

Figure 87: Process Dimension of SAP S/4HANA Transformations Require a Methodology Approach
To fully embrace process transformation as part of an SAP S/4HANA transformation, the 
process dimension plays an important role in all phase of a transition. SAP Activate provides a 
clear guided methodology to deploy, adopt and extend new capabilities across any 
organization for various type of cloud and on-premise solutions in general.
In the SAP Roadmap Viewer you find for the SAP S/4HANA transition various SAP S/4HANA 
related roadmaps, for example, the SAP Activate Methodology for Transition to SAP S/
4HANA. Each of the roadmaps provide a set of recommended activities as well as 
accelerators for the Discover, Prepare, Explore, Realize, Deploy and Run phase of a project 
beyond business process management. The activities are grouped into different workstreams 
such as application design and configuration, integration or extensibility. The process 
dimension is covered in the SAP Activate roadmap already, but not to its full extent, and not in 
all details.
The SAP Signavio for SAP S/4HANA transformation projects methodology is an end-to-end 
business process transformation methodology which is SAP Signavio specific and covers also 
various integration aspects such as the integration with Application Lifecycle Management. 
The focus lies only on all activities in relation to the analysis, design and improvement of 
business processes. The activities are grouped into key steps such as the analysis of

processes, the design or the enablement. They are either supporting existing individual SAP 
Activate tasks or entire phases. They accelerate the SAP Activate tasks by data driven 
insights, and digitalize the results as the basis for a continuous improvement process - after 
all, the transition to SAP S/4HANA is "just" one key process transformation milestone, with 
many more to come as business needs arises.
SAP Signavio for SAP S/4HANA Transformation - New Implementation and System 
Conversion Scenarios Characteristics
The methodology covers two key transition scenarios: New implementation and System 
conversion. The following table provides an overview of the characteristics of both scenarios.

IN SCOPE
Projects with one single go-
live: Build of a new SAP S/
4HANA template (target sol-
ution) followed by a go-live in 
one step
Multi-national or multi-site 
deployment projects: Roll-out 
of a template followed by 
subsequent roll-out loca-
tions / business units (sever-
al Go-Live events), the tem-
plate is continuously updated 
based on learnings from pre-
vious deployments
Value-driven transformation 
projects: The target is to ach-
ieve process improvements 
in case there is a positive 
business case. The transfor-
mation is considered as a 
chance for improvement and 
innovation.
OUT OF SCOPE
Pure technical lift & shift 
projects: The target is to fo-
cus on mandatory activities 
only. The effort of setting up 
Business Process Manage-
ment in SAP Signavio will not 
justify the expected benefit.
ASSUMPTIONS
The analysis of as-is process-
es is considered as beneficial 
also for customers targeting 
a “pure greenfield” / “fit-to-
standard” approach. Rea-
sons:
●
Data-driven Value identifi-
cation instead of calcula-
tions based on assump-
tions
●
Migration of selected data 
required for consistency 
No end-to-end process (re-) 
design including a capability 
and solution mapping execut-
ed in a system conversion 
scenario. Process changes 
are triggered by technical / 
functional / business require-
ments to be realized.

Figure 101: E2E Process in SAP Cloud ALM for Implementation
The E2E Process overview shows the main activities by project roles and project phases in 
which they are executed. The graphic also visualizes the interdependencies and order within 
the different activities.
Project Setup
Figure 102: SAP Cloud ALM - Project Setup
Now, the project lead can create a project in SAP Cloud ALM and select the Activate roadmap 
as the task template. Once selected, all tasks are loaded into the SAP Cloud ALM project and 
the timelines of the project can be specified (Phases, sprints and milestones). Based on the 
Activate roles, the project lead onboards the project team members. They get invited to the 
project via email and see the tasks they are assigned based on their roles. 
In addition, the system landscape can be defined and the deployment plan with their releases 
documented. This can be done also in a later point of time but is required for automated 
testing as well as change and release management.
For all set up activities, please refer to the Application Help ( https://help.sap.com/docs/
cloud-alm/applicationhelp/administration)

Project and Task Management
All Activate roadmap content and accelerators are now available and can be used to track the 
project progress using task management capabilities. Additional tasks and sub tasks can be 
created and planned using the timeboxes and Gantt chart view. Mass edit and excel import 
and export is also available.
Figure 103: SAP Cloud ALM - Consume Tasks from Activate
In the task application, it is possible to have different perspective on the tasks. A lit view 
provides the ability to show all tasks from different sources and then filter, group and search 
for tasks based on the current use case. When opening a task, all content from Activate is 
provided. The tasks can now be used for scheduling, assigning the responsible users, 
maintain the status, add comments, see the history of each task.
Also, a Gantt Chart view can help for further planning or maintaining predecessor and 
successor of tasks.

Project Tracking on Overview Page
Figure 104: SAP Cloud ALM Project Tracking on Overview Page
Using built in capabilities and dashboards, the project progress can be tracked and reported 
on.
Other task sources
Next to the roadmap tasks and SAP Cloud ALM set up tasks, there are other sources of tasks 
in SAP Cloud ALM. If the project is using the SAP Central Business Configuration (CBC) for 
example, the configuration tasks can be loaded, so that central project management can be 
improved. These tasks can be used to navigate to the SAP CBC project to execute the tasks. 
Status information is fed back into SAP Cloud ALM.
Also, tasks coming from SAP Readiness Check can be imported.
An excel import can be used to import own roadmaps.
Analytics
Figure 105: SAP Cloud ALM – Analytics for Project Tracking
Unit 4: Illustrating SAP Cloud ALM

To keep track of the project activities and the configuration, development and testing 
activities, SAP Cloud ALM provides detailed analytics for the individual roles.
Project Tracking in Analytics
Figure 106: SAP Cloud ALM - Project Tracking in Analytics
Project Scoping
Figure 107: SAP Cloud ALM - Consume SAP Best Practice Processes
Before the Fit-to-Standard workshops, the Business Process Expert can select the process 
scope in SAP Cloud ALM. All SAP Best Practice Solution Scenarios provided by SAP are 
available in SAP Cloud ALM. They can be selected and then the required solution processes 
and diagrams can be added to the project scope. If the customer conducted an evaluation 
with the Digital Discovery Assessment tool, the result (excel report) can be used to upload the 
scope directly into SAP Cloud ALM. 
Processes can be organized in multiple scopes (e.g. by LoB or E2E process) and can be 
structured using the process hierarchy. 
The Process Hierarchy can be created based on customer process structure. This helps to 
organize processes, test cases and documents later on.

97
Process Authoring
Figure 108: SAP Cloud ALM – Process Authoring
If required, and if no modeling tool such as SAP Signavio is available, the pre-delivered SAP 
Best Practice Process Diagrams can be copied and adjusted within SAP Cloud ALM – Process 
Authoring. Also, additional value chain flows or BPMN diagrams can be modeled on top to 
visualize, e.g. end-to-end or integration processes. These modeling capabilities can also be 
used by partners to bring their own process content or if no SAP Best Practice content is 
available for the process scope.
Once published, these diagrams can be used in the fit-to-Standard workshops to document 
requirements and later create test cases from the flow of activities.
Fit-to-Standard Workshops
Using the Process Diagrams and the additional assets and supported by a parallel starter 
system for evaluation, the SAP standard is validated with the customer. This process is 
supported by a parallel system for evaluation.

Capture Requirements
Figure 109: SAP Cloud ALM - Capture Requirements
During the validation of the SAP standard processes, additional requirements can be 
captured directly in the process. They can be linked to all elements in the process to define 
where the process or functionality needs to be enhanced. Additional non-process relevant 
requirements can be captured in the Requirements app. An excel import can also be used to 
mass import or update requirements. 
Approve Requirement & Break Into User Stories
Figure 110: SAP Cloud ALM – Approve Requirement & Break into User Stories
The requirement can now proceed through an approval process if necessary. The owner of 
the requirement is notified once the status of a requirement is set to 'in approval' and 'ready 
for approval'. A requirement can also be 'rejected', or set to 'not planned', or 'blocked'. 
Lesson: Illustrating SAP Cloud ALM
© Copyright. All rights reserved.
99
Once approved, the functional expert can specify what is needed to fulfill the requirement. He 
can define user stories that describe the tasks that need to be completed and assign these 
backlog items to the respective teams. 
The user stories should include a description of the work package and the planned sprint in 
which it needs to be developed. The development teams can fine tune the user stories using 
subtasks. These can be assigned to individual developers to support a fine granular status 
tracking. In addition, project tasks can be created manually. In the Gantt chart the 
dependencies of tasks can be maintained. Tasks are assigned to timeboxes, for example 
sprints, but can also have individual due dates. using duration, story points and estimated 
effort, the project team can even do dynamic scheduling and track time conflicts. 
In parallel, the release manager can start planning the releases and development sprints. For 
the requirements, he can create one or more features. These are used to transport the 
changes made in the realize phase through the system landscape, from development to 
testing, and finally to the production systems. 
Solution Process and Requirement Traceability
Figure 111: SAP Cloud ALM - Solution Process Traceability
Using the Solution Process Traceability application in the Analytics give a good overview of 
the overall progress. From here the project manager or process owner can track the related 
elements and their status. It is possible to navigate to all elements from here to see their 
details. 
Documentation
During the project a lot of documentation is created. This can be project documentation, 
solution documentation, interface specification, technical design documents or training 
manuals. All documentation can be managed in SAP Cloud ALM. Although the tool does not 
have a document repository such as SAP Solution Manager, it provides capabilities to create 
documentation directly in the tool using the Document element. The document can be linked 
to the process to enable easy re-use of the documentation beyond the project. 
Unit 4: Illustrating SAP Cloud ALM
100
© Copyright. All rights reserved.
Figure 112: SAP Cloud ALM - Document Management
Documents and their status can also be tracked in the solution process traceability. 
Documents have a status, a priority, a human readable ID. Using the text editor, the content 
can be captured directly in SAP Cloud ALM. External documents such as word documents, 
excels or PowerPoints, can be stored in a local repository, for example, MS SharePoint, and 
linked using an URL reference. An integration of SAP BTP Document Management Service is 
planned.
Release and Deployment Management
Figure 113: SAP Cloud ALM - Deployment Plan
Release and Deployment Management is a multi-step process that involves planning, 
executing releases, monitoring progress, and managing deployment tasks. SAP Cloud ALM 
facilitates change enablement by integrating various deployment tools, enabling the 
orchestration of transport requests throughout the implementation landscape. It provides 
Deployment and Release planning features to help users stay updated on go-live activities and 
ensure seamless software and configuration changes. Additional features, such as the 
deployment of transports and traceability reports, help users track changes effectively. 
Lesson: Illustrating SAP Cloud ALM
© Copyright. All rights reserved.
101
Figure 114: SAP Cloud ALM - Releases and Timelines Application
The Release manager needs to create a deployment plan and its releases in the 'Project 
Setup' application and assign the deployment plan to the project. A deployment plan can be 
assigned to multiple projects. Also, he needs to maintain the deployment landscape as a 
prerequisite to handle the changes across the landscape.
Feature
A feature is a mechanism used to deploy changes across your system landscape. It contains 
landscape information, serves as a container for transportable objects, and includes your 
technical change documentation.
Figure 115: SAP Cloud ALM - Create Feature for Requirements
The change and deployment manager should create one or more features per requirement 
once it has the status 'in realization'. The feature has a predefined status flow. Once the 
change and deployment manager set the status to 'start implementation', the developer can 
assign their transports to the feature. Alternatively, the change manager can create a 
transport directly from the feature in SAP Cloud ALM. In parallel they maintain the status of 
Unit 4: Illustrating SAP Cloud ALM

the related user stories and subtasks. This way, the change and deployment manager can 
track the progress of the development and configuration. Once all user stories are set to 
'done', the change and deployment manager can release the feature from development to 
testing and set the requirements into status 'in testing'. Now, testing can begin.
Figure 116: SAP Cloud ALM - E2E Implementation Status Flow
Test Preparation
Figure 117: SAP Cloud ALM - Test Preparation
In parallel to the development, the test manager needs to work on the test cases. SAP Cloud 
ALM allows the preparation and execution of manual and automated test cases. 
For some solutions, like S/4HANA, the Best Practice content provides standard test cases 
that can be imported into SAP Cloud ALM to accelerate the preparation process.
In the Test Preparation application, the test manager can create manual test cases. He 
selects a scope and the test case type: manual or automated. 
Lesson: Illustrating SAP Cloud ALM
© Copyright. All rights reserved.
103
Figure 118: SAP Cloud ALM - Manual Test Case Preparation
For the manual test cases he can select a solution process and diagram from his scope. By 
doing this, he gets already the list of steps from the diagram as the activity structure. Now, he 
can select which activities are in scope or out of scope and change the order of test activities. 
Figure 119: SAP Cloud ALM - Create Test Actions for Test Activities
To give the testers more details for the test execution, the test manager can describe test 
action, including title, instructions and expected results. This can also include screenshots. 
Test Cases can further be categorized using tags.
For SAP Best Practice Content there are also excel downloads available, which can be used to 
fill the instructions via excel import. For more detailed please read the following blog: https://
blogs.sap.com/2022/07/27/how-to-import-test-scripts-from-the-sap-best-practice-
content-for-sap-s-4-hana-cloud-into-sap-cloud-alm-manual-test-cases/
Unit 4: Illustrating SAP Cloud ALM

Test Automation Integration
For the automated test cases, there are two integrations available.
1. The test automation tool for SAP S/4HANA Cloud is a free automation provider delivered 
as part of the guided configuration tools for SAP S/4HANA in SAP Activate. It enables you 
to test SAP Best Practice processes after implementation or upgrade of SAP S/4HANA 
Cloud. It comes with pre-delivered test automation scripts.
2. Tricentis Test Automation for SAP integrated with SAP Cloud ALM is a continuous testing 
platform that allows you to design automated, functional, end-to-end software tests 
across all layers of your enterprise architecture.
To use these integrations in your project, you need to configure a service and an endpoint in 
the Landscape Management app in SAP Cloud ALM. For more information please check:
https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/setup-administration/integrating-test-automation-
providers?locale=en-US
Test Planning
Figure 120: SAP Cloud ALM - Create Test Plans
In larger implementation projects you might want to run your test activities in iterations and 
therefore need to setup multiple test cycles re-using the same or a similar set of test cases.
You can do this using the test plans. In the test plans application, you can create your test 
plans, describe them, plan the start, and end date and maintain a person responsible. Test 
plans also have a separate status. Then you can assign test cases from the test preparation 
application to your test plan. You can combine manual and automated test cases. The test 
cases can be assigned to multiple test plans and therefore can be executed multiple times.
For more information on test plans, please read: https://blogs.sap.com/2023/08/09/

Test Execution & Defect Management
Figure 121: SAP Cloud ALM – Release Features from Development to Test Environment”
Once the test cases are prepared, the change and deployment manager can release the 
feature with its transports to the testing environment. To know if the feature can be released, 
the change and deployment manager needs to check in the feature traceability analytics, if 
test cases are prepared, and all tasks and user stories are completed as well as the transports 
are assigned. Then the change and deployment manager can handover the feature to test:
Figure 122: SAP Cloud ALM - Execute Test Cases and Record Results
Now the testers can execute the test cases. In the Test Execution application, they can select 
the test case and start the test run. Both, manual and automated test cases, can be executed 
here. For the automated test cases the execution is triggered and results are coming back 
from the test automation tool. For the manual test cases, the tester can set the status of each 
test activity.
Unit 4: Illustrating SAP Cloud ALM
106

Figure 123: SAP Cloud ALM - Defect Management
Depending on the observed behavior during testing, the tester can assign the test status of 
the action. In case of unsuccessful execution, the tester is requested to add a description or 
screenshot. The test results can be saved, to execute the test later, or the test run can be 
finished.
In case of an error, a defect process can be started by creating a defect directly from the test 
execution app. In case the defect is already created in the defect application, it can be 
assigned to the test case and a responsible can be defined.
The defect can be handled in the Defects application. The defect has its own status and 
application as well as analytics to fully manage the defect process.
Testing Analytics
Figure 124: SAP Cloud ALM - Testing Analytics
In the project dashboard there are various testing KPIs. The test manager can quickly see how 
many test cases are in status “prepared” vs. still “in preparation”, see execution status, 
number of failed test runs and defects. More detailed analytics are provided in the Analytics 
application such as executed test cases and actions by status, defect reporting, etc.

Deploy to Production
Figure 125: SAP Cloud ALM - Release To Production and Confirm Requirement
The change and deployment manager can check the testing status in the requirement 
traceability application. Once testing is done successful, the change and deployment 
manager can release the feature to production. Now the requirement status can be set to 
'confirmed'.
SAP Cloud ALM for Operations
In addition to the implementation features, SAP Cloud ALM offers many features, functions 
and processes for operating your cloud centric solution landscapes.

Introduction to Workstreams
Figure 126: Workstreams
© Copyright. All rights reserved.
113
SAP Activate Methodology proposes a set of workstreams for you to organize your work and 
establish the team’s structure. That doesn’t mean that depending on the project, some 
workstreams cannot be split into sub streams or in some cases, merged.
Each roadmap available has a proposed structure that addresses or emphasizes the specifics 
of each implementation. Most roadmaps are for implementation projects for different 
products, some guide you across upgrade projects. One characteristic of the roadmaps is 
that they are industry agnostic. For those working in SAP implementations, you might 
remember the model company concept, or if you are currently working with SAP Best 
Practices, you will find packages specific for the public sector.
One example is for the SAP S/4HANA Cloud Edition, Public Sector.
The suggested workstreams are:
●
Project Management – Administrative operations, budget control, staffing up, overall 
control
●
Customer Team Enablement – Onboarding processes, solution, and product awareness
●
Technical Architecture and Infrastructure – IT design
●
Application Design and Configuration – Detailed solution design, configuration, security 
concepts
●
Extensibility – Development of additional functionalities
●
Integration – Interface design, communication across applications and businesses
●
Testing – Solution validation
●
Data Management – Data loading, data cleansing, data lifecycle management
●
Operations and Support – IT operations, end-user support processes
●
Solution Adoption – Training, organizational change management
●
Analytics – Data modeling, reporting design, and implementation

Project Management Workstream
Figure 127: Project Management Workstream, SAP Activate for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition (3-System 
Landscape)
Project Management can be seen as a generic workstream that addresses topics like:
●
Organization – How to structure the different teams that will take part in the project.
●
Governance – How to address roadblocks, how to reach consensus, how to escalate.
●
Standards – What to document, how to document, with what detail, which tools should the 
team use to document, test, and deploy, how to report and process incidents and change 
requests.
●
Budget – How resources should be allocated, how to consider a request for change and its 
impact.
●
Planning – How to approach the different project goals, will you use agile or a waterfall 
approach, most likely a hybrid approach between these two.
●
Signoff – How to verify if the project is ready to move on (QGates), with which criteria?

Project Governance
Project governance provides a framework in which the project manager and sponsors 
can make decisions that satisfy both stakeholder needs and expectations and 
organizational strategic objectives or address circumstances where these may not be in 
alignment.
© Project Management Institute, Inc. A guide to the project management body of 
knowledge PMBOK Guide. Sixth edition. 2017.
Project Governance includes:
●
Guiding and overseeing the management of project work
●
Ensuring adherence to policies, standards and guidelines
●
Establishing governance roles, responsibilities and authorities
●
Decision-making regarding risk escalations, changes and resources (e.g. team, financial, 
physical, facilities)
●
Ensuring appropriate stakeholder engagement
●
Monitoring performance
It is important in any project to have the standard definition of the Project Governance. It 
outlines the relationship between the different groups and stakeholders involved in the 
project.
The project governance describes the flow of information between the project and all the 
stakeholders. It specifies the decision making and escalation steps to resolve issues.
Unit 5: Outlining Workstreams

Figure 129: Governance Framework
The governance framework has a couple of characteristics that need to be established. It 
focuses on realizing the business value, managing the risk and issues, and enforcing the 
standards and accountability for the project.
It needs to be aligned with the governance that the organization already has in place. It also 
has to ensure that communication and messaging fits the organization and stakeholder 
needs. Governance needs to be adjusted to each customer. There is no one size that fits all.
SAP provides tools to support the documentation and track the overall progress status. 
Traditionally, SAP Solution Manager was used but with the advent of cloud-based solutions, 
SAP Cloud ALM has become more common. For SAP S/4HANA cloud edition it’s 
recommended to use SAP Cloud ALM.
In an on-premise scenario, a project manager most likely will be using SAP Solution Manager 
to perform is documentation and tracking activities. In a cloud scenario, SAP Cloud ALM will 
be more common. The trend in SAP is to evolve from SAP Solution Manager to SAP Cloud 
ALM.
In a on-premise scenario a project manager most likely will be using SAP Solution Manager to 
perform is documentation and tracking activities, in a cloud scenario SAP Cloud ALM will be 
more common. The trend in SAP is to evolve from SAP Solution Manager to Sap Cloud ALM.
Both tools, SAP Solution Manager and SAP Cloud ALM can provide the single source of truth 
for the project documentation, for all workstreams. Solution Documentation has now been 
used for more than 20 years in SAP projects.
This tools functionality can cooperate with other products, SAP and no SAP, for different 
purposes from documentation, testing, process modeling … one example that is taking a 
major role in SAP implementations is SAP Signavio.
The Project Manager establishing the governance needs to identify the key players who will be 
a part of the governance and then build in the stakeholder group. Generally the key players 
are specified within the project contract or Statement of Work (SoW).

a) Access the SAP Signavio Process Navigator using https://me.sap.com/
processnavigator/, and browse the scope items for SAP S/4HANA Cloud edition, 
Public Sector.
2. Open the SAP Activate Roadmap Viewer (sap.com) and choose the SAP SuccessFactors 
implementation roadmap. Review how the different workstreams have roles to play across 
the different phases. Would you keep this workstream breakdown? Would you merge or 
split? Look at Customer Team Enablement and Solution Adoption? Merge?
a) Open the SAP Activate Roadmap Viewer using the link https://go.support.sap.com/
roadmapviewer/ and look at the SAP SuccessFactors implementation roadmap
Figure 131: SAP Activate Methodology for SAP SuccessFactors
Answer: It’s highly dependent on the project size and complexity. In a large project, 
splitting workstreams could take place. Just consider a global rollout where the 
extensions are built, some focusing on reporting, others in transactional operations. 
Customer team enablement in a smaller project can have the same players as solution 
adoption and in that case, why not merge both streams?
3. Open the SAP Activate Roadmap Viewer (sap.com) and look at the SAP S/4HANA 
implementation roadmap. Why is the Customer Enablement absent?
a) Open the SAP Activate Roadmap Viewer using the link https://go.support.sap.com/

Figure 132: SAP Activate Methodology for Transition to SAP S/4HANA
Answer: You will not always require all the workstreams. E.g. when you do the 
transition to S/4HANA one possible scenario is the system conversion. In this scenario 
the organization is moving from an existing solution to an evolution where much will 
look familiar. Customer Enablement has a more relevant role when a shift occurs into a 
new solution – one example: you have been running Human Resources in SAP ERP and 
now you move to SAP SuccessFactors, here the shift in features and functionality will 
be much stronger and therefore Customer Enablement work stream is strongly 
needed.

1. What is the SAP Activate Roadmap Viewer?
The SAP Activate Roadmap Viewer provides access to Solution Implementation 
Roadmaps, which represent a structured approach to the software implementation 
process.
Activities are split into distinct phases, with deliverables and tasks that help project teams 
to better plan, execute, and manage their implementation project.
2. SAP Solution Implementation Roadmaps aim to assist by providing implementation 
Project Teams with recommended lists of the following:
●
Deliverables (the 'what') in each phase.
●
A process description in the form of details and tasks (the 'how').
●
Accelerators (such as templates, examples, guides, and web links) to be used in the 
Project Library.

Application and Configuration Workstream
To facilitate the work of configuration, development, and security implementation, SAP 
provides several tools and resources. One of the most important examples is the SAP Fiori 
Library. When using SAP Best Practices, you will find a relation between the app and the 
scope item codes.

Figure 138: Relation Between Fiori App and Best Practices Scope Items
In the SAP Fiori Library, you will find information about which Fiori apps are available for each 
product, which are the prerequisites (addons, patch level), how to install and configure the 
app, which security roles are provided, if it's possible to extend the app, features, and look 
preview. If you have the right access to the SAP support platform, you can access SAP 
Maintenance Planner to identify the upgrade or update the path that you will allow to bring 
your current solution to the required software levels. SAP Fiori apps library also allows the 
identification of related apps that can be relevant for end users.
One of the advantages of the SAP Fiori Apps Library, is, that it allows the identification of 
related apps that can be relevant for end users.

Train the Trainer (TtT)
Figure 144: Train the Trainer (TtT)
When a new solution is implemented, new learning needs will arise as impacted users will 
need to learn new ways to perform their tasks.
One critical task is the related to Organizational Change Management (OCM).
The purpose is to conduct all relevant Organizational Change Management (OCM) analysis 
(change impact analysis, communication needs and channel analysis, learning needs 
analysis, and stakeholder analysis) to develop and plan OCM activities for what, when, and 
who. This supports an efficient and effective OCM delivery impacting change readiness and 
end user adoption.
The next step is to identify and nominate change agents as the ambassadors to support the 
digital transformation.

SAP Activate Methodology for SAP SuccessFactors
Figure 145: SAP Activate Methodology for SAP SuccessFactors
When you look into the roadmap for SAP SuccessFactors and check the solution adoption 
workstream, it seems that the solution adoption is not much present in the early phases of the 
project. That is not correct. The emphasis provided the overview diagrams sets focus on 
some activities but once you explore the content (tasks and accelerators), you will notice that 
activities will take place. OCM impact analysis takes place in the Explore phase like for other 
roadmaps.

Customer IT
The test planning starts early in the Explore phase and it will take place during the Realize 
phase.
The testing starts from an atomic approach, like unit testing or even to unit integration testing 
until it starts to address end to end processes. Other scope elements can be included, like 
security testing or performance testing.
Not all types of tests are always relevant when you build something new. There’s no point on 
conducting regression testing. When you change something that is already built, regression 
will allow you to identify any possible side-effects.

Concepts of Data Management
Data Management Workstream consists of three substreams:
1. Data Migration: deals with migrating legacy data (master data as well as very limited 
transactional data) into target SAP S/4HANA system.
2. Data Volume Management: aims at keeping required system performance level and 
optimizing TCO by storing the right (mostly transactional) data in the right place.
3. Master Data Management: target is high data quality and data unification and its efficient 
management within business solutions landscape.
DVM concept is used for (1) decreasing volumes of migrated data, for example, by 
implementing DVM measures in source SAP ERP system before System Conversion and (2) 
avoiding explosive data growth in the SAP S/4HANA system.
Figure 154: Data Volume Management – Key Measures
Video: Summarizing the Key Measures of Data Volume Management
For more information on Summarizing the Key Measures of Data Volume 
Management, please view the video in the lesson Discovering the Workstreams in 
your online course.
Following are the key measures of data volume management:
●
Data Avoidance: Deactivating the creation of data, e.g. posting data from MM
●
Data Summarization: Aggregating data at higher level if enough for the business, e.g. 
controlling line items by period may not be required
●
Data Deletion: Deleting out-of-date records from the online database which are no longer 
required by business processes or legal compliance, for example, spool data
●
Data Archiving: Removing legal compliance and/or product liability data that needs to be 
kept for a longer period from the online database to a different storage medium with 
access and display them after their moving by the application

Concepts of Technical Architecture and Infrastructure
This workstream can play quite different roles, some will be common across different 
roadmaps. In any project during the Realize phase, you will be performing changes to the 
existing security objects, for example, business roles based on the requirements collected in 
the Explore phase. When you adopt a new solution or convert from a earlier version, changing 
security definitions that translate into what a user is authorized to do or not are always to be 
expected.
As systems have become more integrated and hybrid scenarios more common, SAP has 
developed new solutions that can handle the needs of cloud and on-premise implementations. 
Examples of those solutions are:
●
SAP Cloud ALM
●
SAP Identity Services
Figure 155: Technical Architecture and Infrastructure
●
Technical Architecture and Infrastructure for SAP Implementation is first captured during 
Discover phase and contains points of view on:
-
Data center strategy
-
Scalability, availability, and capacity (hardware sizing) requirements
-
SAP recommendations on system landscapes for a specific solution
●
Based on initial point of view, initial hardware specifications are developed for purchasing 
hardware. Because detailed requirements and solution design are discussed during 
Explore phase. The sizing should only be relevant for Private Cloud Edition as it is the only 
on-premise approach offered.

During the Realize phase, a performance test is conducted to confirm that the solution is 
ready for productive load. Corrections in hardware might be required.

Describing Workstreams in Cloud 
Implementation
LESSON OBJECTIVES
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
●
Describe the different workstreams in a cloud implementation scenario
Description of the Workstreams in Cloud Implementations
In this lesson, we will be addressing some of the specifics of different workstreams in a cloud 
implementation scenario.
Note that RISE implementation initiatives, even if done in a cloud environment will have many 
similarities with on-premise implementations, so they will be covered here.
Before we proceed, in the SAP Activate Roadmap Viewer, you will find roadmaps for specific 
solutions like SAP SuccessFactors, but one roadmap combines the implementation activities 
for different products.
Figure 157: SAP Activate Methodology for the Intelligent Enterprise
This roadmap is intended to guide the project team through the implementation of business 
scenarios enabled by two or more SAP products, integrated within the intelligent enterprise.
Business scenarios in the roadmap are:
●
Scenario – Hire-to-Retire
●
Scenario – External Workforce
158
© Copyright. All rights reserved.
●
Scenario – Source-to-Pay
●
Scenario – Total Workforce Management
Products related to the scenarios and represented in the roadmap are:
●
SAP S/4HANA Cloud
●
SAP SuccessFactors
●
SAP Fieldglass
●
SAP Concur
The roadmap is comprised of phases, deliverables, and tasks in accordance with SAP Activate 
Methodology of SAP products that the customer is licensed for. In addition, accelerators are 
linked to the relevant deliverables and tasks making them easy to consume at the point in the 
project that they are needed.
To facilitate the adoption of SAP Cloud products, several services and tools are available. One 
example is the Strategic Advisory Service for Analytics.
As an introduction to cloud data warehousing considerations, SAP offers a Strategic advisory 
service for analytics. This service integrates and socializes analytics into business operations 
and decision making. Company-wide use of analytics requires a governance framework that 
includes standardized setup, adoption, and application. By defining a governance model and 
analytics target architecture, this service formulates an analytics strategy that considers 
users, processes, and technology. Within a shorter time frame, companies can extend their 
business value by using analytics to operate more effectively and create strategic 
advantages.
The service includes:
●
Identification of strategic business drivers and change-management needs to define the 
analytics vision and strategy
●
Delivery of a custom road map to determine the analytics target architecture
●
Creation of an analytics governance model to establish standards and processes for setup, 
adoption, and use
The service is offered in three scope options:
●
Baseline Package: This introductory option socializes in-depth advisory services with the 
customer. In a quick assessment, high-level opportunities and quick wins are identified.
●
Enhanced package: This intermediate service initiates in-depth analytics with a 
transformation road map. The package includes a baseline service scope, value 
proposition, analytics capability formulation, and recommendations for governance, 
standards, architecture, and project execution.
●
Extended package: This enhanced service scope provides ongoing support. A dedicated 
analytics advisor is assigned as the central contact for all discussions about analytics 
solutions from SAP, and manages related initiatives to deliver business value for medium- 
and long-term execution.
Application Design and Configuration Workstream
When implementing cloud based solutions, not only you find that agile approaches are more 
commonly used, but several solutions follow practices where predefined available content 
Lesson: Describing Workstreams in Cloud Implementation

159
leverages the overall implementation. Like SAP Best Practices, in SAP S/4HANA, other 
solutions have similar content available. One example is SAP SuccessFactors.
Another aspect that is common is the fit-to-standard analysis, from roadmap to roadmap 
there are small variations, but the principles are the same. Even in solutions where much 
more creativity and adaptation is expected (like in Analytics solutions), you still refer to the 
available standard as much as possible. One example is SAP Data Warehouse Cloud 
preparation steps for the fit-to-standard workshops:
●
Understand customers' future enterprise analytics strategy, transformation objectives, 
and agree on process and solution design principles and expected project value and 
benefits.
●
Agree on process scope.
●
Review all the necessary Implementation Design Principles (IDPs) Documents based on 
the project scope. Prepare any necessary material to be presented to the customer.
●
Review all the necessary leading practice process diagrams related to the solution.
●
Prepare fit-to-standard environment to be used for system walkthroughs during fit-to-
standard workshops.
●
Book rooms and materials for the workshops.
●
Invite and send out the agenda and schedule of the workshops to all key participants.
●
Confirm the materials and internet access provided on the day of the execution workshop 
before the official start.
Testing Workstream
Figure 158: Testing Workstream Activities in Realize Phase (SAP SuccessFactors)
Unit 5: Outlining Workstreams

© Copyright. All rights reserved.
In any project, there will be different types of testing. Sometimes the structure within the SAP 
Activate Roadmap Viewer can differ from one product to another, to one type of 
implementation to another. Still some principles apply.
Unitary testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, volume testing, performance testing, 
string testing (business process testing), user acceptance testing, data conversion testing, 
and so on, usually will always, with different levels of detail and impact.
For example, in your SAP SuccessFactors project you find out that payroll processing takes 
too long. The impact will be to review your subscription with the hyperscaler (cloud provider), 
update the architecture documentation, and so on. No need to go back to the drawing board. 
If it was an on-premise solution (you could keep running payroll in SAP S/4HANA), you might 
need to procure new hardware and that will bring much larger delays than just some updates 
to the architecture documents or the subscription agreement.
Testing Workstream Activities in Realize Phase (SAP Data Warehouse Cloud)
Figure 159: Testing Workstream Activities in Realize Phase (SAP Data Warehouse Cloud)
The picture above gives another example of testing activities, but now for the SAP Data 
Warehouse Cloud.
Don’t you think that security testing applies on any project? Is it not common to include UAT 
(user acceptance testing)? In any project, user acceptance testing takes place in the Realize 
phase. It’s needed for achieving signoff for the customer, but when reviewing the activities 
listed in which roadmap, it's not always explicitly highlighted. The explanation is that not all 
roadmaps will have a exhaustive list of tasks and deliverables. It’s always good practice to 
familiarize yourself with several roadmaps.
Another example, looking into SAP Activate for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition (2-
system landscape) roadmap, if you check the Create Test Strategy task, you will find a 
common sequence of tests to be performed in a Cloud Implementation.

161
Test cycle, a sequence of testing activities typical of an implementation project can be 
represented by:
●
Unit Testing (if applicable)
●
Business Process (String) Testing
●
Integration Testing
●
Data Conversion Testing
●
User Acceptance Testing
Some of the findings of these tests can also include aspects related to performance, for 
example, throughput. Depending on your project jargon, you will notice that business process, 
string, or end-to-end testing look like synonyms.

Lesson 3
Describing Workstreams in On-Premise 
Implementations
LESSON OBJECTIVES
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
●
Describe the specifics of different workstreams in on-premise implementations
Description of the Specifics of Workstreams in SAP S/4HANA On-Premise 
Implementations
In this lesson, we will cover the specifics of SAP S/4HANA on-premise implementations. It’s 
the most common example for implementation projects on the existing customer base. And, 
for a customer already running SAP ERP, the first question will be, new implementation 
versus system conversion.
The SAP readiness check allows you to identify the most impacted areas and can be useful to 
estimate the cost of conversion versus the benefits of new implementation.
The SAP readiness check for SAP S/4HANA focuses on high level findings, for example:
●
Simplification Item Relevance
●
Custom Code
●
Recommended SAP Fiori Apps
●
SAP S/4HANA Sizing
●
Add-on Compatibility
●
Business Functions
When you run an SAP on-premise implementation for products like SAP S/4HANA, you have 
different transitions paths (for more information, refer to Unit 5). Amongst the possible 
transitions, you will find greenfield (new) implementation and system conversion.
System conversion is one of the examples where development and code review activities take 
a fundamental role, and the older the history of the SAP system in the organization, the more 
relevant they became.
Think about this example. A customer started its ERP implementation back in the mid 90s 
when the SAP ERP solution was still called SAP R/3. It upgraded later to SAP ERP and now is 
converting the system into an SAP S/4HANA. You have almost 30 years of development 
history there and take into consideration that the functionality you find nowadays is quite 
different from 30 years ago. Many processes didn’t exist or didn’t provide enough coverage 
for the organization needs. SAP solution matured over time. If in this 30 years no major code 
overhauling took place, then you will find that one of the most critical tasks for your system 
conversion project is related to Custom Code. You need to evaluate the impact of custom 
166

code, access its quality, phase out obsolete code, and replace nonstandard code with 
standard functionality when it’s possible.
Figure 160: SAP Activate Methodology for Transition to SAP S/4HANA
Historically the importance of reviewing custom code can be characterized has a long and 
intensive task, starting in Explore phase, where you understand how much you should keep, 
deprecate, or remove and later in Realize phase, you perform the adjustments. In the 
diagram, notice the CC: Custom Quality task.
For those familiar with the history of SAP over the last 30 years, it’s easy to find examples 
where major changes took place. Some examples could be real estate or treasury, even 
human resources is quite different from what was available in the earlier editions of SAP R/3.
Figure 161: Custom Code Adoption
1. As-Is analysis: Gain full transparency on your custom code situation in the productive SAP 
ECC.
2. Decommission unused custom code: Decommission custom code which is not in use. This 
activity may start long time before a system conversion, during conversion, and should 
continue afterwards.
3. Back-to-Standard where possible: Try to replace custom code with SAP or partner code. 
This holds true for modifications, clones and so on, and for custom code areas which are 
impacted by simplifications.
4. Adjust custom code for SAP S/4HANA (re-design/re-platform): Many existing custom 
code objects will run on SAP S/4HANA without any need for adjustment. However, some 
code objects must be adjusted. (for example, by using 'Quick Fixes'), and some should be 
adjusted according to the extensibility concept for SAP S/4HANA (in-app, side-by-side).
Make yourself familiar with the extension concept of SAP S/4HANA. Please see the document 
'Custom Extensions in SAP S/4HANA Implementations - A Practical Guide for Senior IT 
Leadership' in the accelerator section.
Lesson: Describing Workstreams in On-Premise Implementations
© Copyright. All rights reserved.
167
Make yourself familiar also with the topic of custom code migration. SAP recommends the 
following information sources:
You should start with the SAP Blogs 'SAP S/4HANA System Conversion – Custom code 
adaptation process' and 'Semi-automatic custom code adaptation after SAP S/4HANA 
system conversion', and the 'FAQ document on custom code adaptation'.
Another good starting point into the topic is given in the SAP White Paper 'Custom Extensions 
in SAP S/4HANA Implementations'. This white paper is about the essential concepts for a 
modern enterprise application’s extensibility, guides through the key aspects of dealing with 
custom code during a system conversion, and offers practical advice for customers who run a 
new implementation of SAP S/4HANA or launch new SAP technologies.
Another good overview document (with many links included) is 'Custom Code Management 
during an SAP S/4HANA Conversion'.
Another workstream with a much larger presence in on-premise systems, is operations and 
support. Moving to a new solution, even if you are just converting from an older SAP ERP 
system, brings new challenges and the need for new skills. In this example, your SAP ERP was 
running with SAP ASE database and your developers were working with ABAP WebDynpro 
technologies. Now you move to SAP S/4HANA and you have a new technologies to support 
and troubleshoot SAP HANA and SAP Fiori. You have code being moved to the database and 
you have OData Services side by side with Web Services. One critical task is related to 
accessing the impact on operations.
Figure 162: SAP Activate Methodology for Transition to SAP S/4HANA - Operations and Support
During the operations impact evaluation activity, the SAP S/4HANA project scope is analyzed 
to evaluate potential operational risks and areas in the support framework that need to be 
looked at and modified or implemented prior to the go-live. The aim is to define the list of 
operational activities which:
●
Need to be newly set up. For example, in case SAP Fiori Apps are newly introduced, the 
administration and operation of the front-end server needs to be defined and set up and 
resources need to be trained on the systems involved and their configuration. In addition, 
support processes like incident management need to be able to handle the new 
component.
Unit 5: Outlining Workstreams
168

●
Are existing but must be modified. For example, daily backup routines need to be adjusted 
to properly fit the new SAP S/4HANA solution. Support tools like monitoring, 
troubleshooting, or software logistics tools need to be in place. Processes like master data 
management need to be revisited to define new policies required by the major changes in 
the master data structure.
●
Can be retired. For example, DB routines and scripts for AnyDB can be retired. AnyDB 
monitoring set up should be retired as well.
All the relevant support areas need to be analyzed in a comprehensive manner that is 
analyzing all the roles and skills required for the support of the SAP S/4HANA solution, the 
processes and procedures, the operations documentation, and the enabling support tools.
SAP can support you in all these activities with a systematic approach to operational 
activities, which will ensure you analyze all the changes in IT operational activities caused by 
the new solution.
Once the affected support areas are analyzed in a systematic way, a roadmap is defined that 
includes the key activities for IT to fill the gaps and prepare the future IT support framework. 
The key activities required are many, and include:
●
Defining the sourcing strategy for a new role. Project resource moving to operations, ramp 
up of a current resource to support the new solution, hiring, or handover of activity to 
partner.
●
Setting up and configuring tools and where SAP will be engaged to support.
●
Documenting operating procedures by project resources or by operational resources.
●
Organizing for knowledge transfer to ensure the future operational resources have the 
required knowledge and skills. This includes formal education of current operational 
resources, training, hands on and shadowing on new solutions. It also includes training of 
all the IT support resources involved in the support of the new solution like the service 
desk.
●
Operations cutover activities (team access, roll over of open defects, and so on).
●
Retirement of some part of the current support framework.

Describing Workstreams in Upgrades
LESSON OBJECTIVES

Description of Workstreams in Upgrades
Implementation versus Upgrade
As you have learned in the previous lessons, most roadmaps focus on implementation. 
Nevertheless, you will find variants of the SAP Activate Roadmap methodology for some 
upgrade scenarios. As of January 2023, there were two upgrade roadmaps available:
●
SAP Activate for Upgrade of SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition (3-system landscape)
●
SAP S/4HANA Upgrade and Product Integration
Figure 163: SAP Activate for Upgrade of SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Public Edition (3-System Landscape)
The first thing that you will notice is the absence of several phases of the SAP Activate 
Methodology and workstreams. The reason for this is the nature of the product. SAP S/
4HANA Cloud, public edition is Software as a Service (SaaS). It doesn’t allow you to make any 
major changes to the product itself.
SAP releases new versions of its products at a fast pace. They bring a mix of minor changes 
and some major innovations, so one typical activity with a upgrade will be the update to 
existing business roles that grant access to new or changed features.
In the upgrade roadmap for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, you find a critical task during the Realize 
phase:
Revise Business Roles and Business Catalogs
174
© Copyright. All rights reserved.
The purpose of this task is to adapt existing business catalogs and business roles resulting 
from the addition of new scope items or an upgrade. In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, business 
catalogs are periodically revised.
Some business catalogs will be deprecated and replaced by new ones. The deprecated 
business catalogs in the customer system will be removed two releases later. Hence, it is 
important to review the retired business catalogs after each release and addition of new 
scope items, and make the necessary changes as soon as possible. You can find more 
information in the Identity and Access Management Release Activities accelerator.
Upgrading SAP S/4HANA
Figure 164: SAP S/4HANA Upgrade Scenarios
Video: Describing the SAP S/4HANA Upgrade Scenarios
For more information on Describing the SAP S/4HANA Upgrade Scenarios, 
please view the video in the lesson Describing Workstreams in Upgrades in your 
online course.
An SAP S/4HANA upgrade includes three main scenarios:
●
Purely Technical Approach – you want to keep the system running as much as possible as 
before, you just cope with the SAP release strategy.
●
Leverage Innovations – most of the existing functionality and processes will remain the 
same, but you will adopt new functions and sometimes, you might replace a previous one. 
Some examples include decommissioning an extension since the new release covers a 
requirement previously identified as a gap.
●
Embed LoB Products – integrate with the new release of SAP S/4HANA complementary 
products. Can be seen as a more ambitious variant of Leverage Innovations.
Lesson: Describing Workstreams in Upgrades

175
Figure 165: SAP S/4HANA Upgrade and Product Integration Roadmap
SAP Activate proposes one common roadmap for all three upgrade scenarios. Even in the 
simplest scenario for purely technical approach, some activities will be critical. One example 
is testing (regression testing). You need to do a walkthrough of your existing business 
processes and interfaces, and verify if they still work. From a practical perspective, testing 
workstream is always a critical role here, and it can be the most resource and time intensive 
workstream.
SAP S/4HANA Upgrade and Product Integration Roadmap
Figure 166: Solution Adoption Activities in SAP S/4HANA Upgrade
Unit 5: Outlining Workstreams
176
© Copyright. All rights reserved.
If the new release doesn’t add much to what you currently have in place, then many activities 
will be optional. For example, if the screens where you create a purchase requisition still work 
the same way, the solution adoption workstream doesn’t need to address training. That is not 
true when you have innovations in place.
Other workstreams can play major roles due to the nature and scope of your innovations. For 
example, if you had SAP S/4HANA running Accounting projects, now your innovations bring 
extended warehouse management, procurement, and real estate. In this case, you started 
with an upgrade project, but within that upgrade project you have an implementation project. 
What do you do? Start with the upgrade roadmap but don’t miss the chance to merge it with 
SAP S/4HANA implementation roadmaps.

Review Upgrade Roadmap Content
1. Review the content tab for any upgrade roadmap, and comment about the activities listed 
there.
a) The answer is in the roadmap description.
Since the product will change in the upgrade, we have activities for test regression, and 
most likely there will be some changes to existing features, shouldn’t we include 
something related to training? The answer is in the roadmap description.
“The roadmap can be used as a standalone mini project for a customer who is already 
live with SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, and doesn’t have any ongoing projects. It 
can also be used in parallel, or have tasks added to an ongoing new implementation or 
continuous improvement project. It is recommended to plan an upgraded specific 
sprint, and have regression tests as part of the sprint.”
Figure 167: The Roadmap Focus - Upgrade Without any Innovation.
If you face changes in functionality or while adopting new features shipped with the 
new release of SAP S/4HANA, you will combine this roadmap with components from 
the implementation roadmap.”

Product Integration as a good starting point.
And if my very specific upgrade project focuses on a product without specific roadmaps, 
like SAP Business Integrity Screening? Well, the SAP Activate Roadmap Viewer then 
becomes an inspiration. In any project, you need incident management tools. You need to 
define the standards that should be applied to how you design a test script or how to 
document developments and configurations and how to manage organizational change. 
SAP Activate roadmaps can be a source of good ideas for your own project, even if it has

RISE with SAP
Figure 168: RISE with SAP
The key premise of RISE with SAP is to simplify a customer's move to the cloud and deliver 
continuous innovation throughout their business transformation journey.
Customers moving to the intelligent enterprise come from a variety of backgrounds, and have 
different end goals.
For example:
●
Established companies facing complex, customized, on-premise systems.
●
Early adopters of cloud ERP ready to go further.
●
Digitally-driven businesses that need to scale quickly.
●
Edge innovators that need to focus on their core.
RISE with SAP is designed to address unique customer scenarios. RISE is not a system 
upgrade, but rather a redesigned way of working that allows you to continually transform as 
your business requires, a Business Transformation as a Service.
RISE with SAP supports customers in:
●
Modernizing - on the best cloud infrastructure to achieve the lowest possible TCO.
●
Standardizing - on the best intelligent suite to drive process efficiency and scale.
●
Digitizing - on the best transformation platform to innovate faster than your competition.

●
Hyperscaler partners to provide the cloud infrastructure included in the offer.
●
Service partner community to provide their world-class tools and expertise to help make 
migrations faster, and help customers get the most value for their investment. SAP is not 
competing with our qualified service partners to deliver implementation services, but 
relying on them early in the sales cycle to work with customers.
SAP will lead with service partners for services in the areas of:
●
Advisory and implementation services needed to help customers assess business needs, 
plan, manage, and execute a successful implementation of their business transformation.
●
Application management services needed for ongoing support of applications such as 
monitoring and maintaining software patches, performance, quality, and security.
●

Technology Platform.
Figure 170: SAP S/4HANA Cloud Deployment Options
Unit 6: Describing Transition Paths
192
© Copyright. All rights reserved.
In a cloud model, a customer pays a subscription fee to use computing resources. The 
software to run your day-to-day business transactions and activities is SAP S/4HANA. The 
public cloud deployment is a new implementation with a fresh system, and offers the lowest 
total cost of ownership (TCO) with an easy to set up, and easy to use system based on 
standard SAP Best Practice business processes.
The private cloud deployment can be a new implementation, but also supports system 
conversion from an existing SAP ERP on-premise system. This enables customers to maintain 
many of their existing business processes and customizations while gaining the value of cloud 
architecture and services. The private cloud also supports the same functional scope as SAP 
S/4HANA on-premise, including all 25 industries, whereas the public cloud has a more 
focused finance-led core ERP scope with a few selected industries, such as Professional 
Services.
Public cloud is multi-tenant, and private cloud is single-tenant. Tenancy refers to the number 
of tenants or customers that share the memory and bandwidth of a server. You can think of a 
multi-tenant server like an apartment building. All tenants share the core infrastructure and 
resources, but each has their own secure apartment unit within the building. Within a unit, one 
can make their own design and decor choices, however they cannot make major structural 
changes. And if there is a problem in your apartment, you call the building maintenance to 
resolve the issue, instead of having to take care of it yourself.
With the public cloud solution, customizations are made through SAP Fiori apps designed to 
facilitate those changes (for example, Custom Fields and Logic and Custom Business 
Objects). This means extensions are guaranteed to be lifecycle-stable through future releases 
and therefore require less maintenance and attention. For complex customizations that 
cannot be done through the existing Fiori apps, the SAP Business Technology Platform 
extension suites are readily available and easily integrated to SAP S/4HANA Cloud. These 
public cloud characteristics - multi-tenancy, standardization, outsourcing maintenance of the 
system to your cloud provider, and lifecycle- stable extensions, result in the lowest TCO and 
highest return on your investment.
With single-tenancy, there is a single tenant, or customer, on one server. Similar to being the 
only tenant in your own house, you have complete freedom in customization, including 
structural changes such as modifying the SAP source code. With private cloud, customers 
that require a high degree of control and customization get the best of both worlds. You still 
get full visibility and control with access to the backend of the system through the SAP GUI, 
but you also get to outsource the infrastructure and technical software maintenance to cloud 
providers under one contract.
A public cloud deployment is recommended if a customer has the ability and mindset for a 
transformational project, low landscape complexity, and can implement a greenfield 
approach. The implementation will include:
●
A complete, modern, SaaS ERP solution with full public cloud benefits the fastest path to 
innovation and lowest TCO.
●
A clean Cloud ERP solution without converting old/legacy ERP processes and 
configurations.
●
To re-imagine business processes and take advantage of standardized best practices.
A private cloud deployment is recommended if a customer has plans for a long-term 
evolutionary journey to the cloud with high landscape complexity including mostly 
fragmented, highly customized systems.
The implementation will include:
Lesson: Describing RISE with SAP

193
●
A rapid conversion of their existing SAP ERP/ECC environments to a modern, cloud-based 
architecture.
●
Full enterprise management scope as subscription and low TCO with the cloud structure 
SaaS landscape at your own pace.
●
Full, extensive, ERP functionality including partner add-ons with the ability to extend and 
enhance as required.
●
In addition, upgrades of SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition are based on SAP timelines, 
and upgrades of SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition are based on time lines agreed 
between SAP and the customer.
Figure 171: Hyperscaler Choice
A cloud software a service (SaaS) solution requires infrastructure to host the solution. 
Infrastructure refers to the physical servers where your software is installed. A building with 
many rooms full of these servers is called a data center. SAP has its own data centers, and we 
partner with other companies that provide infrastructure services, who are referred to as 
hyperscaler partners.
Our hyperscaler providers include Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and 
Alibaba Cloud. When customers use an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider, they do 
not have to buy the physical hardware or employ in-house experts to maintain it. The classic 
'on-premise' concept refers to a customer purchasing and owning their own servers on 
company property, and installing and maintaining their software in these servers.
For the public cloud deployment, SAP is the default infrastructure provider. This enables us to 
offer customers the lowest TCO with a complete, packaged SaaS offering.
For the private cloud deployment, customers can choose their preferred infrastructure 
provider from our hyperscaler providers, SAP, or in special cases, the customer's own data 
center. These special cases are reserved for customers in regulated industries, public sector, 
or in countries with data residency requirements.

SAP Business Technology Platform
Figure 172: SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP)
The BTP is a platform as a service and is included as part of the RISE with SAP contract 
subscription. This subscription provides customers with access to all BTP software and 
services. It’s important to note that while some services are not charged, others do include a 
service fee.
The BTP enables customers to easily extend and integrate with any SAP, partner, or third-
party solution, using the same data model and business services as SAP applications. With 
the BTP, customers can easily gain new business insights from their unified data across 
applications.
Key capabilities of the Business Technology Platform include:
●
Database and data management solutions provide the ability to handle the growing 
amounts of data stored in multiple locations by providing controlled access for your entire 
organization to analyze and act on a single source of the truth.
●
Analytics solutions enable users to provide real-time insights through machine learning, AI, 
business intelligence, and augmented analytics to analyze past and present situations, 
while simulating future scenarios.
●
Application development and Integration capabilities simplify development and accelerate 
integration on an open cloud platform.
●
Intelligent technologies optimize processes, maximize resources, and kick-start 
innovation.

Figure 173: Cloud Platform CPEA Credits
Cloud Platform Enterprise Agreement (CPEA) credits are negotiated during the sales process, 
with a certain number of credits allocated to a customer at no additional cost. CPEA credits 
are like a prepaid debit card used to consume services on the SAP Business Technology 
Platform. Customers can always purchase additional credits as needed. With CPEA credits, 
customers have the opportunity to try different services on BTP without having to commit to 
the service for a full license period.
Characteristics of CPEA credits:
Customers make a prepaid investment in cloud credits for the contract duration with an 
annual commitment to consume SAP Business Technology Platform services. This model is 
suitable for customers that have well-established and planned use cases and who want the 
flexibility of turning services on and off, and switching between services, without the 
commitment of being tied to a single service throughout the duration of the contract.
Customers receive a monthly balance statement that provides information about the usage 
consumption of each service and the corresponding costs. The total monthly cost is deducted 
from the cloud credits balance and billed annually in advance. Any overages are billed in 
arrears at list price, but you can purchase additional credits at any time to prevent overages 
ahead of time.

Understanding SAP S/4HANA Cloud Landscape
Figure 175: SAP S/4HANA Cloud
The system landscapes used for SAP S/4HANA implementations Cloud and On-Premise 
include:
SAP Cloud ALM
Manage your implementation and landscape with SAP Cloud ALM.
SAP Cloud Identity
SAP Cloud Identity is the default identity provider for SAP S/4HANA Cloud and provides 
secure authentication and single sign-on for users in the cloud.
SAP Central Business Configuration
SAP Central Business Configuration (CBC) is a Configuration hub for SAP S/4HANA Cloud. 
It’s a service of SAP Business Technology Platform where you provision your SAP S/4HANA 
Cloud systems (Starter, Quality, and Production), activate the business scope, and complete 
configuration-related activities. Configurations are moved from CBC to SAP S/4HANA Cloud 
through transports. SAP CBC is used by customers after go-live to continue to maintain their 
SAP S/4HANA Cloud solution by activating new scope, countries, and making configurations.
Starter System
The starter system includes the Enterprise Management scope and comes with 
preconfigured business processes and master data. The data and configuration in the starter 
system directly aligns with the scope item test scripts in SAP Signavio Process Navigator.
Quality System
The quality system is provisioned and configured via CBC based on the data and 
requirements gathered during the Fit-to-Standard workshops. After your S/4HANA system is 
live, the Quality System will act as a test environment for further configurations. After 
thorough testing, extensions can be transported from quality to production using the 
Software Collection transport SAP Fiori apps in S/4HANA Cloud. Other activities that are not 
Unit 6: Describing Transition Paths

managed by transport management are done directly in the SAP S/4HANA Cloud quality 
system.
Production System
The production system is provisioned via the CBC and kept in sync with the Quality system via 
weekly or bi-weekly transports. Same as in quality system applies to not transportable 
configuration. The guided workflow tasks in the CBC instruct the implementation team 
members when to make these configurations in the production system. After go-live, the 
production system is used by end users to run the organization's business processes.
Sandbox System
Subscription based tenant for testing innovation without impacting the Q or P Systems, 
without transport path.
Note:
Ideally, the quality and production systems are mirror images of one another so 
business process testing or extension testing in the quality system accurately 
reflects what would occur in the production system (for example, if a new 
extension is transported to production). However, the transport path only moves 
in a single direction from quality to production. The test data refresh service was 
developed to solve this problem and provide an ideal testing environment by 
syncing data in the production system with the quality system. test data refresh is 
a subscription service that refreshes master and transaction data in the quality 
system from the production system. A built-in depersonalization feature ensures 
data privacy compliance. Learn more about Test Data Refresh in the SAP 
Community.
Consume SAP Best Practice Processes in SAP Cloud ALM

with the Digital Discovery Assessment tool, he can use the result (excel report) to upload the 
scope directly into SAP Cloud ALM.
Integrate SAP Central Business Configuration with SAP Cloud ALM
Figure 177: SAP Cloud ALM - Central Business Configuration Integration
With SAP Central Business Configuration integration, you can use SAP Cloud ALM as the 
guiding system. You get an order in which the tasks need to be executed and seamlessly 
navigate to SAP Central Business Configuration. The configuration tasks can be loaded, so 
that central project management can be improved. These tasks can be used to navigate to the 
SAP CBC project to execute the tasks. Status information is fed back into SAP Cloud ALM.
Figure 178: Central Business Configuration
SAP Central Business Configuration is designed to provide guidance for your implementation 
project by controlling the sequence of activities that are completed. In the project experience,

you can manage your team members, complete activities to set up and configure your 
systems, and view the project status. Activities are grouped into phases, and each phase ends 
with a milestone.
Figure 179: Central Business Configuration
The configuration activities in SAP Central Business Configuration are designed to support 
customers in adapting the preconfigured SAP Best Practices content to their requirements. 
The available configuration activities are based on the active scope and country selections. 
Configuration activities may vary by country, because not all business scenarios (scope 
items) are available in all countries. Configuration activities can be mandatory, 
recommended, or optional.
Figure 180: Provisioning Cloud Systems
As SAP S/4HANA Cloud is offered directly through SAP, it benefits from the many user- 
friendly services within the cloud portfolio.
A 3-system landscape is also available as an option if customers require a Development 
system for SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

Figure 181: Test Automation Tool for SAP S/4HANA Cloud
The test automation tool is integral part of SAP S/4HANA Cloud. With preconfigured test 
scripts you can automate your business process tests. You can further change existing or 
create new test cases via the recording functionality. In addition, improved regression testing 
is supported by SAP delivered test automates on app level.
Figure 182: Manage Your Test Processes
With the Manage your test processes app, you can create and manage test processes that 
represent the business processes in an organization. A test process, or multiple processes 
must be added to a test plan in the app, test your processes to execute the actual test in the 
system. The implementation team works with customers to build test plans with the standard 
test processes, and modify test processes to align with any extensions or customizations 
made based on the Fit to Standard workshops.
The test processes available in the manage your test processes app are based on the scope 
enabled in your system, as each test process automate aligns directly with a business process 
(scope item) active in your system. The test process automates are essentially automated

SAP Cloud ALM allows the preparation and execution of manual and automated test cases. 
The Best Practice content provides standard manual test cases that can be imported into 
SAP Cloud ALM to accelerate the preparation process. With integration to the Test 
Automation Tool for S/4HANA Cloud, when scoping a solution process which has automated 
test cases in the Test Automation Tool, this automation test case will be automatically 
synchronized and can be executed directly in SAP Cloud ALM.

SAP Roadmap SAP Activate for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition provides guidance for all 
process phases from Discover to run. Selected ones are described below:
Business Driven Configuration Questionnaires are used as a reference during the Fit-to-
Standard workshops. Answers are used to foster discussion to help identify backlog items 
and requirements needed for the solution realization. All backlog items and delta 
requirements are defined and documented in each workshop. There can be multiple waves for 
each Fit-to-Standard workshop depending on the complexity of topics.
Business Process Experts execute scenarios demonstrated during the Fit-to-Standard 
workshops in the Starter System
All process flows, backlog items, and delta requirements are reviewed and validated for 
completeness after being defined during the Fit-to-Standard Workshops.
Handover of requirements and process flows to expert teams and delta requirements are 
reviewed and converted into backlog items.
All backlog items are reviewed and consolidated into one Backlog. The scope for the first 
implementation phase is determined and items descoped are documented for future 
implementation phases.

New Implementation SAP S/4HANA (On-Premise)
Figure 186: New Implementation Overview
In this New Implementation scenario also called Greenfield, customers implement a new 
instance of SAP S/4HANA (on-premise) by moving either from a non-SAP legacy system or 
from an older SAP solution. In this scenario, customers can refine their business processes, 
focus on key innovations and start adopting new cloud based solutions. Customers may only 
want essential master data and transactional data from their existing solution, such scenario 
will be described in the lesson 'Understanding System Conversion'.
Configuration Terms

For more information on Describing the Configuration Terms, please view the 
video in the lesson Analyzing options for (Greenfield) New Implementation on 
SAP S/4HANA Cloud, SAP S/4HANA (on-premise) and SAP S/4HANA Cloud, 
Private Edition in your online course.
The following are Best Practice process terminology and their related definitions:
●
Scope Item: A business process that defines a certain click-path and applications to use to 
complete a business activity in the system. SAP Best Practices business process can also 
be referred to as a scope item.
●
SAP Best Practices Content: Standard business processes/scope items delivered by SAP. 
Every time there is a release upgrade, enhancements are made to the standard processes.
●
Content Activation: The process of writing content of the customer solution into system 
tables.
●
Active Content: The content (for example, SAP Best Practices) of the customer solution 
that has been activated.
●
Customer Adaptation Content: The content modified by the customer so that it differs 
from the SAP Best Practices content.
●
Building Block: A self-contained and reusable entity of business content. It is the smallest 
logical unit in the SAP Best Practices content architecture and includes customizing 
and/or master data steps for the corresponding piece of business content.
Figure 188: Deploying Best Practices for New Implementation
The tool for deploying SAP Best Practices in an SAP S/4HANA private cloud or on-premise 
system is the SAP Solution Builder. The focus of the Solution Builder is on solutions. A 
solution contains a set of SAP Best Practices scenarios which are predefined process flows 
for a particular line of business or business area. Scenarios consist of one or more building 
blocks, which are self-contained, and reusable entities that include customizing settings 
and/or master data steps.

207
Best Practices are only activated once in the development system. Transports are used to 
provide the quality and production systems with the business configuration defined in the 
development system.
All of a customer's business processes documentation live in the central library in Solution 
Manager called Solution Documentation. When customizing SAP Best Practices to a 
customer's requirements, do not edit the SAP Best Practices directly. Make a copy and edit 
the copy. Additional customer-specific content and supporting documentation is also created 
and maintained in Solution Documentation.
Figure 189: Side by Side Extensibility
The SAP Business Technology Platform provides developers with a modern extensibility 
framework and enables developers to implement loosely coupled extension applications 
securely, thus implementing additional workflows or modules on top of the existing SAP 
solution they already have. All standard SAP solutions are offered with in-app customizing 
capabilities. For additional customer requirements, the SAP Business Technology Platform 
extension capability can help developers build, deploy, and operate their new functionalities 
easily and securely in on-premise or cloud SAP solutions.
Extensibility in SAP Business Technology Platform is divided into three suites:
Extension Suite - Development Efficiency
Extend and optimize business processes in your existing applications and simplify 
development with low-code tools to create innovative applications faster.
Extension Suite - Digital Experience
Deliver consistent, personalized, and unified user experiences across business applications 
and multiple channels at scale.
Extension Suite – Digital Process Automation
Automate repetitive and manual tasks with digitalized workflows and robotic process 
automation bots.
Predefined process content packages designed for specific lines of business and industries 
enable you to implement customizations quickly and easily.

Figure 190: SAP Cloud Connector
The Cloud Connector facilitates secure communication between SAP cloud solutions and 
protected on-premise networks that cannot be accessed directly from the internet and acts 
as a reverse invoke proxy component that is installed and runs on an on-premise network. 
Cloud connector is used in hybrid scenarios where cloud applications must access or extend 
on-premise software.
Compared to the approach of opening ports in the firewall and using reverse proxies in the 
DMZ to establish access to on-premise systems, the Cloud Connector offers the following 
benefits:
●
You don't need to configure the on-premise firewall to allow external access from SAP BTP 
to internal systems. For allowed outbound connections, no modifications are required.
●
The Cloud Connector supports HTTP as well as additional protocols. For example, the RFC 
protocol supports native access to ABAP systems by invoking function modules.
●
The Cloud Connector lets you propagate the identity of cloud users to on-premise systems 
in a secure way.
●
Easy installation and configuration, which means that the Cloud Connector comes with a 
low TCO and is tailored to fit your cloud scenarios.
●
SAP provides standard support for the Cloud Connector.

The Realize phase is where the configuration activities are performed. In this phase all 
requirements identified in the Explore phase are built and tested. This generally happens 
(implementation approach specific) using an agile development approach in SAP Activate.
Agile development refers to developing and delivering work in small, consumable increments. 
The unit to measure progress and cross team alignments is called a sprint. A sprint is a time- 
box to organize your implementation and development efforts to serve the purpose of 
incrementally building the solution.
To support agile development, you can leverage SAP Focused Build, which is a ready-to-run 
tool integrated with SAP Solution Manager for managing agile projects. SAP Focused Build 
has no additional cost, and supports building the solution in short, time-boxed sprints, with 
frequent inspection points by the customer.
Focused Build for SAP Solution Manager in the SAP Help Portal.
Figure 192: Solution Manager Test Suite
The SAP Solution Manager Test Suite is used to manage and execute testing for SAP 
solutions on-premise. You can plan the scope of testing required for cross-system business 
processes, manage the tests centrally, and execute those tests.
The SAP Solution Manager Test Suite supports:
●
Manual and automated functional tests
●
Tests for SAP and non-SAP solutions
●
Functional tests for on-premise, cloud, and hybrid solutions

strategy to identify any gaps with SAP Fiori apps not available inside of the standard solution.
Planning for the user experience is covered in more detail in week two of the openSAP course 
'How to Deliver a Great User Experience with SAP S/4HANA' (https://open.sap.com/

courses/s4h18). Follow the full course to get a full understanding on how to plan and deliver 
SAP Fiori UX as well as to get access to info and accelerators that can be used in 
implementations.
Figure 194: Accelerator - Sizing Approaches
An additional consideration when implementing on-premise solutions, is sizing of the 
hardware. The size of the hardware and database is influenced by both business aspects and 
technological aspects. This means that the number of users using the various application 
components, and the data load they put on the network, must be taken into account.
With the help of SAP Standard Application Benchmark results at www.sap.com/benchmark, 
statements can be made as to CPU consumption and memory consumption of particular 
software components.
For sizing, we have identified three different and independent sizing models. The first two, 
user-based sizing and throughput-based sizing, have been implemented in the Quick Sizer.
User-based sizing
We defined three types of active users who work with the system to a different degree. Merely 
counting the users can be done quite easily. The estimation is quite rough as it says very little 
about the actual throughput these users produce.
Throughput-based sizing
This model is quite thorough as it calculates sizing on expected throughput. Assumptions in 
business terms (for example, number of order line items per year) need to be cross-checked 
against the individual installation.
Customer Performance Test
The according tests are done in a customer system with customer data. The disadvantage is 
that conducting these tests requires considerable time and money. For further information 
please refer to the white paper Carrying Out Customer Performance Tests.

Initial Data Load
-
Transfer the business data needed to run the new system by loading master and open 
transactional data from the legacy system.
-
The SAP S/4HANA Migration Cockpit facilitates migration of legacy data to the target 
SAP S/4HANA system. Two types of data are migrated.
-
Master Data: Core business objects such as activity, cost center, bank master, 
customer, and supplier.
-
Open Items: Open transactional data such as financial balances, sales orders, and 
purchase orders.
Figure 197: SAP S/4HANA Cloud, Private Edition Landscape
The SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition system landscape is as follows:
Sandbox (SBX)
SBX is used by implementation consultants to deliver fit-to-standard workshops to customer 
experts with the purpose of gathering configuration and customization requirement data.
Development (DEV)
Development system is used for configuration and development of customizations and 
integrations. Once completed, these are transported to the quality system for testing.
Quality (QAS)
Configuration from the Development system is transported to the quality system where 
testing is performed before anything is transported to production.
Production (PRD)
Configuration from the quality system is transported to production system. The production 
system is used day-to-day to run the customer's business activities.

215
Figure 198: SAP Best Practices
When deploying an SAP S/4HANA Cloud private edition scenario, SAP activates the Best 
Practices process inside of the system through the technical service provided to the 
customer by SAP. Configuration Best Practices are only activated once in the development 
system. Transports are used to provide the quality and production systems with the business 
configuration defined in the development system.
The Best Practices documentation is available in SAP Cloud ALM. When customizing SAP 
Best Practices to a customer's requirements, do not edit the SAP Best Practices directly. 
Make a copy and edit the copy. Additional customer-specific content and supporting 
documentation is also created and maintained in Solution Documentation.
Five Golden Rules
When deploying an all-SAP solution, it is important to stick to the Clean Core concept, to 
foster a cloud mindset by adhering to fit-to-standard and agile deployment detailed in SAP 
Activate. These include:
1. Foster a cloud mindset by adhering to fit-to-standard and Agile deployment detailed in 
SAP Activate
●
Leverage SAP Standard processes where possible
●
Deploy your solution incrementally with short releases and sprints
2. Use preconfigured solutions with defined processes: Use SAP Best Practices, Enterprise 
Management Layer and/or partner templates
3. Use modern integration technologies
●
Use APIs for integration
●
Use SAP Business Technology Platform functionality for cloud integration
4. Use modern extensibility technologies
●
Use SAP S/4HANA key user extensibility for in-app extensions
●
Develop customer extensions in side-by-side approach using the SAP Business 
Technology Platform
Unit 6: Describing Transition Paths
216
© Copyright. All rights reserved.
●
Leverage business logic extensibility within in-app extensibility. Avoid classic coding 
enhancements (for example enhancement points, BADI's, user exit and so on) where 
possible.
●
No SAP standard source code modifications.
5. Ensure transparency on deviations
●
Any deviation must be clearly documented as part of the implementation. This helps 
the customer to replace these with standard capabilities, if they are offered in the 
future.
●
Use standard capabilities of SAP application life-cycle management tools to document 
the solution.
Five Golden Rules - Benefits
Customers that adhere to these principles realize the following benefits:
●
Faster time to value
●
Lower cost of initial deployment
●
Ability to absorb innovation delivered by SAP at a faster rate
●
Lower risk during the deployment of the solution
●
Higher flexibility and lower reliance on one implementation partner
●
Deployment of future-proof solution utilizing modern technologies
The above are the benefits and/or advantages of adhering to the golden rules.
Figure 199: Plan for the User Experience
When compared to SAP S/4HANA Public Cloud implementation, SAP Fiori deployment is an 
additional consideration for new implementation of SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition. 
Depending on the type and scope of contract, there are certain activities with respect to SAP 
Fiori deployment that the SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud team may undertake, and there may 
be activities that the project team may have to do. For example, deployment of SAP Fiori apps 
may be done by the SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud team, or it may fall within the scope of the 
project team. The activities that the project team must take care of should be clarified with 
the SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud team, and must be implemented by following the high-level 
plan for the UX track in an implementation as shown here.

217
However, in comparison to the new implementation of SAP S/4HANA on-premise, the project 
team should work with the SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud contact to determine the scope, 
process, lead time, and so on, for performing some of the configuration and update activities. 
For example, activating SAP Fiori apps or applying SAP Notes. This kind of co-ordination and 
dependency is an additional consideration compared to SAP S/4HANA on-premise 
implementation, as some activities like using the Software Update Manager tool are SAP’s 
responsibility when deploying a cloud-based solution.
Figure 200: Roles and Responsibilities Document
It is important to read through the roles and responsibilities document to understand the role 
of the customer and the role of SAP when deploying SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition. 
There are several services which are delivered by SAP under the agreement, as well as 
additional services that can be requested, some of which carry related costs.

Lesson 3
Analyzing System Conversion
LESSON OBJECTIVES
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
●
Analyze system conversion
System Conversion
Figure 201: System Conversion Overview
System conversion is a transition scenario that existing SAP ERP customers can opt to apply 
to convert their existing SAP ERP solution to SAP S/4HANA. This includes retaining their 
business data, custom development, and configuration. Customers choosing this scenario 
may want to minimize change initially and then innovate selectively going forward.
In a system conversion scenario (while alternatives exist), it is highly likely that the customer 
will invest in new hardware to run the SAP S/4HANA application. This is due to factors like the 
database running in memory. Customers perform an initial sizing, and procure the new 
hardware based on the sizing results at the beginning of the project.
© Copyright. All rights reserved.
219
Figure 202: Primary Conversion Steps
These are some of the primary steps performed when converting an existing SAP ERP system 
into a new SAP S/4HANA system.
The primary steps of a system conversion are:
1. Prepare ERP System: Clean up custom code and reduce data volumes
2. Database Migration: Move to SAP HANA database (only if source is on a DB other than 
HANA)
3. System Update: Provide new applications and tables
4. Data Conversion: Convert table content to new data model.
5. Software Configuration: Implement SAP S/4HANA mandatory and simplification items 
and reuse majority of existing processes
Software Update Manager (SUM) is the tool that facilitates the database migration, software 
update, and data conversion steps. The SUM creates a shadow repository on the target 
database. A shadow system consists of a shadow instance and a shadow repository.
Database Migration Option (DMO) is an optional feature of the Software Update Manager 
(SUM) tool. It combines three system conversion processes into a single step procedure: 
database migration + system update + data conversion.
System Move adds an additional step that facilitates migration to new data centers. The 
functionality reduces complexity, downtime, transition time, and costs of the system 
conversion by packaging multiple steps together and adding the system move to facilitate 
switching from the old servers to new servers in the target hyperscaler.

Lift and Shift Approach
Figure 203: Lift and Shift Approach
Lift and Shift moves an entire system without change to a new landscape. For example:
From SAP S/4HANA On-Premise 2020 to SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition 2020.
The primary steps to Lift and Shift a system are:
1. Check Prerequisites: Source system must be on a supported release.
2. Provision Target System: Provision new hardware in the new landscape.
3. Backup and Restore: Use Software Provisioning Manager to back up the current system 
and restore it on the target system.
Video: Illustrating the Lift and Shift Approach
For more information on Illustrating the Lift and Shift Approach, please view the 
video in the lesson Analyzing System Conversion in your online course.
Figure 204: Technical Overview
The technical overview diagram displays a high-level view of the SUM (Software Update 
Manager) process. Software Update Manager is a tool used by the SAP Basis team to upgrade 
SAP on-premise software. This tool is also used in the system conversion scenario to upgrade 
the SAP ECC system to SAP S/4HANA.
There are other tools used in this process, which include:
Lesson: Analyzing System Conversion
© Copyright. All rights reserved.
221
●
SAP readiness check: Responsible for identifying which components need to be adjusted 
on SAP ECC in order to work on SAP S/4HANA
●
Maintenance planner: Responsible for calculating the upgrade path
●
DMO: Responsible for the Database Migration and Data Structure Conversion from any 
database to the SAP HANA database
The SUM process starts with the conversion of the existing SAP ERP Sandbox system. When 
starting the conversion, SUM will perform a series of checks on the Sandbox. After running 
the checks, SUM will fail and specify what components are not suitable for conversion. This 
list serves as baseline for the activities to be performed in order for the conversion to be 
completed successfully.
Once all SUM prerequisites are adjusted and/or adapted to work on SAP S/4HANA, the SUM 
process is started again and the sandbox system converted. This activity can be performed 
several times to the satisfaction of the project team. Once satisfied, the team will start the 
planning of converting the Development, Quality and Production systems.
Figure 205: DMO of SUM Process
DMO is available with Software Update Manager 1.0 SP09 and higher, and can be used for 
systems based on AS ABAP. It can be used for other target database types as well.
The processing sequence is based on the shadow system functionality of SUM. The SUM 
creates the shadow repository on the target database until downtime phase, while in parallel 
the SAP HANA database is setup (client, schema, and so on). Then the database connection 
of the SAP system is switched to the target database, and then the downtime starts. After 
migration of the application data (including data conversion), the upgrade is finalized and the 
SAP system runs on the target database. The source database continues to run and the 
application data in it is not modified, so it remains a fallback throughout, until the process is 
successfully completed.

Figure 206: Readiness Check for SAP S/4HANA
For the transition from SAP ERP 6.0 to SAP S/4HANA, SAP provides information about the 
relevant changes that might have an impact, grouped by simplification items, from the 
simplification item catalog. The SAP Readiness Check provides the subset of the 
simplification items that may apply to your analyzed system.
Figure 207: Readiness Check for SAP S/4HANA
The following area is covered by the SAP Readiness Check for SAP S/4HANA:
●
Add-Ons and Business Functions
-
SAP Add-ons and business functions as well as third party add-ons have to be checked 
for their compatibility with SAP S/4HANA
-
SAP software is listed and rated
-
Third party software is listed only

●
Data Volume Management
Analysis of data volumes in sources system
●
Recommended SAP Fiori Apps
SAP Fiori deployment follows the same considerations as that for new implementation of 
SAP S/4HANA on-premise. This is an activity that the project team must take care of by 
following the high-level plan for the UX track in an implementation as shown here. SAP 
Fiori apps recommended based on the transaction usage history in the evaluated system 
will additionally help to determine the UX scope.
●
SAP S/4HANA Sizing
The SAP S/4HANA sizing check lets you run a sizing simulation and provides information 
about your sizing values and data volume management potential. To calculate the right 
target SAP S/4HANA system size, consider the initial target SAP S/4HANA size calculated 
from your current SAP ERP database size, future database growth, possible data volume 
reduction, and potential new functionalities.
Figure 208: Simplification Item Checks
The Simplification Item Check serves two purposes:
1. Relevance check: Determine which simplification items are relevant for the specific 
system in which you are running the simplification item check. This shall help you to 
assess the functional and technical impact of the system conversion on your system.
2. Consistency check: During the conversion process, your system will be migrated to the 
new data structures and new processes. The conversion routines rely on consistent data 
in the system in order for this to happen automatically. If the simplification item check 
Unit 6: Describing Transition Paths
224

identifies data inconsistencies or missing mandatory preparation activities which could 
cause the system conversion to fail, it will make you aware of these issues so you can 
correct or exempt them before the actual system conversion starts.
Simplification items check can be done and compared using the simplification database, 
which can be found in any SAP NetWeaver 7.5 system and above.
Figure 209: Using Retrofit During Conversion
When performing a system conversion, new hardware is generally provisioned to support the 
SAP S/4HANA solution. This results in a temporary dual landscape (maintenance and 
project). The project landscape is an exact system copy of production (with data 
desensitized).
As the project team start their conversion activities, the maintenance team continue their 
business as usual changes through the maintenance environment. This means that every 
time a maintenance change goes through the maintenance landscape, the project landscape 
is now out of sync. We use Retrofit to keep the project environment in sync with the 
maintenance landscape. Retrofit copies the change into the project landscape to keep the 
environments in sync.

Lesson 4
Illustrating Selective Data Transition
LESSON OBJECTIVES
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
●
Illustrate selective data transition
Selective Data Transition
The Selective Data Transition covers the migration of relevant business data from SAP ERP to 
SAP S/4HANA. It allows a tailored scope between system conversion and new 
implementation with the flexibility to adapt data and processes in one step. The approach 
allows to combine redesign of business processes with retaining historical data aligned to a 
new business reality.
The Selective Data Transition path works with both the new implementation and system 
conversion transition scenarios. SDT provides a mean of 'selecting' specific data or 
configuration and 'carving' these elements out of the source system and into the target 
system. Using the SAP LT (Landscape Transformation) tool, customers can tailor their scope 
relative to their unique scenarios and move these elements across.
Figure 210: Selective Data Transition Options
Selective Data Transition allows transfer of data from one or more existing ERP solutions to a 
new SAP S/4HANA solution. You select which data to transfer which can include:
●
ABAP repository of objects and developments
●
Configuration (customizing) data
●
Master data
© Copyright. All rights reserved.
227
●
Transaction data (open items and a time-slice of historical closed items, for example, 2 
years)
There are two common approaches:
1. Shell Conversion
●
A shell copy of the production system is made without master and transaction data, 
and converted to SAP S/4HANA. This option is best if most of the original processes 
are being reused.
●
Then by using applying the Selective Data Transition scenario, specific scope can be 
carved out of the source system and copied to the target system.
2. Mix and Match
A new SAP S/4HANA install is created and elements of existing configuration and ABAP 
repository are transferred. This option is best if the majority of the solution is being 
redesigned.
Shell Conversion versus Mix and Match Landscape
Figure 211: Shell Conversion versus Mix and Match Landscape
In this diagram, we compare the difference between a Shell Conversion vs Mix and Match, as 
below:
What is Shell Conversion Approach?
In a shell conversion scenario all data from the SAP ERP system is removed, leaving the 
system with the configuration and developments only. The system conversion scenario is 
then used to convert the system to SAP S/4HANA. After the completion of the conversion, 
the data is then migrated to the newly converted S/4HANA system.
What is Mix and Match Approach? 
If the customer would like to redesign most of their business processes but still retain some of 
their existing enhancements, then a mix and match model would be the most viable approach. 
The mix and match approach starts with a new implementation scenario, which is then 
followed by a selective data transition, which selectively chooses the setting required to be 
retained from the existing SAP ECC system.

SAP LT Enabled Scenarios
Figure 212: SAP LT Enabled Scenarios
Selective Data Transition is enabled through the SAP LT (Landscape Transformation) tool. 
The following are the key capabilities and scenarios this tool is used for:
●
Consolidation of multiple system into one
●
Migration of Business Units
●
Migration of selected applications
SAP Landscape Transformation Tool
Figure 213: SAP Landscape Transformation Tool
SAP landscape transformation is made up of analysis and transformation tools to use as part 
of your migration, conversion, or reorganization projects. It works very similarly to a data 
migration tool which connects to source systems, transforms data, and loads to the target.

229
SAP Landscape Transformation (LT) enables companies to align their existing SAP system 
landscape after restructuring their business, updating existing processes, integrating a 
recently acquired company, or removing parts of the business data due to a divestiture from 
their existing SAP system landscape. SAP LT ensures full data consistency and data integrity 
within transformation projects such as data migrations and data conversions.
SLT Tool Capabilities
Figure 214: SLT Tool Capabilities
Here are some of the elements and capabilities.
In addition to the above, SAP LT unifies that data in the target system, so as not to have 
duplicate entries.

Big bang adoption or direct changeover is the adoption type of the instant changeover, when 
everybody associated with the old system moves to the fully functioning new system on a 
given date.1
Phased adoption is a strategy of implementing an innovation (for example, information 
systems, new technologies, processes, and so on) in an organization in a phased way, so that 
different parts of the organization are implemented in different subsequent time slots.2
Figure 229: ERP Implementation Strategies – Adoption Approach - Compare
Cloud multitenant software is sometimes called vanilla when not customized from their 
original form, meaning that they are used without any customizations or updates applied to 
them.3
Commercial off-the-shelf products are packaged solutions which are then adapted to satisfy 
the needs of the purchasing organization.4
Custom Software is software that is specially developed for some specific organization or 
other user.5*
